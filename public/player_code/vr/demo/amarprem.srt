Lakhaniya, Take Nandu inside!

22
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,489
Ram!

23
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,145
Such a small child lost his mother!

24
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,236
God has been unjust to you!

25
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:49,569
Whose it?

26
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:52,483
Pushpa!

27
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:54,055
Are you coming from your in laws place?

28
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,606
Yes

29
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,109
Spoiled face...

30
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:03,457
.....upset!

31
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,415
Definately something is wrong!

32
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,362
Uncle who is she?

33
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,414
You remember Damodar Dayaal?

34
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,070
Who liked chanting!

35
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,693
Yes

36
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:12,639
She is his daughter!

37
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,305
Mother

38
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,839
Pushpa what brought you here?

39
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,569
Mother!

40
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:24,427
What happen?

41
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,563
Why are you crying?
Have you fought and come?

42
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:29,700
I will never return back again

43
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,180
I will stay here

44
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,467
With you

45
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,369
Have you lost it?

46
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:35,125
Atleast say what happen?

47
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,029
I couldnt conceive...

48
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,181
So he married another girl!

49
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:40,838
What?

50
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,533
Yes mother

51
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:43,453
I tolerated this!

52
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:47,795
I kept tolerating their torture!

53
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:51,186
Still you shouldnt have left
your house!

54
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,661
A husband's house is a woman's
world for her!

55
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:55,923
I wanted to die there!

56
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:59,054
But I was helpless and so
I have come here

57
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,820
I dont accept this!

58
00:06:01,157 --> 00:06:02,396
Even you must be at fault!

59
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,083
My fault was....

60
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,183
......I lived there inspite of
this torture!

61
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,107
But today...

62
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:12,950
...see this!

63
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,315
They hit me with a burning stick!

64
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,436
And then they pushed me out
of the house!

65
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:22,966
My child!

66
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,052
If you also dont support me...

67
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:28,849
....where else will I go?

68
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:32,552
I'm living with the help of others

69
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:34,770
How will I feed you?

70
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,458
Dont you worry mother!

71
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,375
I'll beg!

72
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,581
I'll find a job from somewhere!

73
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:43,774
But dont ask me to return back!

74
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,599
Dont ask me to return back

75
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:47,501
Dont cry!

76
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:48,642
Dont cry

77
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:50,223
Come inside!

78
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,140
C'mon

79
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,762
Mahesh, this time your wedding should be a grand one!

80
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,289
What are you saying!

81
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,779
If Nandu was not a child.....

82
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,698
.....I wouldnt have got
married for the second time

83
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,949
That is there

84
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:06,661
But

85
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,475
Pushpa was at your place?

86
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,857
Its a wrong decision!

87
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,206
Why did she come to your place?

88
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,867
To ask for a job!

89
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:21,775
For a job?
-Yes

90
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,750
I know her in laws
very well!

91
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,116
Belongs to a gluttonous family!

92
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,572
Definitely there's a problem!

93
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,561
Must be, I havent asked!

94
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,847
Anyway, forget that!
Tell me one thing...

95
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,156
.....when has the auspicious date for wedding
been fixed?

96
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,546
On the 24th of this month!

97
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,926
Very good, quickly got engaged followed by immediate
wedding!

98
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:40,343
Look dont worry about anything!

99
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,236
I'll make all the arangements!

100
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,046
Okay I am leaving

101
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,720
Pushpa!

102
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:11,512
You are shy?

103
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,356
You sat on my lap when
in your childhood!

104
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:15,902
Again I went wrong!

105
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,720
You played on my lap in your childhood!

106
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:19,734
You remember?

107
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,206
Then how can you forget me?

108
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,554
Why did you go to Mahesh's
place to ask for job?

109
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,922
When mahesh told me about this
I was very upset!

110
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,687
I wouldnt like inspite of me
being present...

111
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:32,997
.....any problems come to you or
your mother!

112
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,316
I'll give you work!

113
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,234
You?
Yes!

114
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,001
I have a big business in Calcutta!

115
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,905
I have land, and a house!

116
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,201
But no one to look after it!

117
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,883
Whenever I go there!

118
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:46,465
I swipe the floor!

119
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,466
I prepare my food!

120
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:49,688
If you take care of all that...

121
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,129
.....you benefit yourself!

122
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:52,298
And will even benefit myself!

123
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,665
But, uncle... I!

124
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:57,538
I am talking for your good!

125
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:01,376
In Calcutta is there a shoratge
of servants?

126
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:02,486
No

127
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:04,644
My mother is old....

128
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,990
...how can I leave her alone and go?

129
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,038
Yes you have to think about it!

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,687
I am in no hurry!

131
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,211
You think and give me an answer!

132
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,890
I give you a job there!

133
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:17,416
Okay

134
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll think about it and let
you know!

135
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:37,381
You?
What is it?

136
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,901
Manjula Bhabhi, can I borrow some
rice from you?

137
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,786
Borrow?
Why dont you say you.....

138
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:45,490
....have come to beg!

139
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:47,481
Okay think like you
are giving me alms!

140
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,481
I am not asking for myself!

141
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:51,409
I'll stay hungry!

142
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:53,386
But my mother!

143
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,438
Go away from here!

144
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:58,063
Arent you ashamed of leaving
your husband and begging everywhere!

145
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,328
Its a sin seeing you!

146
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:00,864
Go!

147
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,560
Pushpa!

148
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,066
You went to my place, right?

149
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,977
Sister in law, insulted you and
removed you, right?

150
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,862
No

151
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,969
The one who has no respect,
an insult doesnt matter!

152
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:30,605
Dont say this Pushpa

153
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,666
Take this keep the money!

154
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,151
But

155
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,335
Keep it!

156
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,215
Keep it

157
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,863
The help you have given me...

158
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:46,147
Forget that, you should
help one another!

159
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:50,066
I have helped you and you...!

160
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,295
What do you mean?

161
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,312
No one is there on the other
side of lake in the evenings!

162
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,913
Arent you ashamed?

163
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:58,666
You are like my brother!

164
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,545
By giving me money you want
to buy me?

165
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,146
Did you see it?
-Yes mother!

166
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,986
Uncle caught her hand and
gave her money!

167
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,385
Really?

168
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,432
Come along with me!

169
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,960
But what happen?
Atleast tell me!

170
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,269
Your daughter has coaxed my

That you called your daughter
to coax others?

00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:51,659

182
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:58,593

Shamless

185
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,865
How much did you take
from her brother in law?

186
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,811
And why did you take?

187
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:07,694
Mother

188
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:09,484
Dare if you call me mother

189
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,099
Why dint I die before hearing...

190

....what all she said because of you!

191
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:16,638
Mother atleast listen to me!

192
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,073
Go away from here!

193
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:22,818
You are an Unchaste woman
and so your husband has thrown you out!

194
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,493
Go and drown yourself somewhere!

195
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:31,461
How dare you insult my brother in law!

196
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:45,881
Pushpa, what are you doing?

197
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,233
You are going to commit suicide?

198
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,047
Very bad, get up!

199
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:53,615
Had I passed away?

200
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,762
Its sheer disgrace, inspite of me being there
you face problems!

201
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:57,681
Come right now!

202
00:12:57,763 --> 00:12:58,264
Come to Calcutta!

203
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,241
So many times have we asked
you girls to watch movies!

204
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,829
They dont like folk songs!

205
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,421
People like songs of movies!

206
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,796
None of you like working!

207
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,580
Aunty Greetings!

Nepal Babu, you have come here after
so long, welcome!

209
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:26,868

00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,009

211
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,366
Come

212
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:33,197
Who is she?

213
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:34,354
Pushpa

214
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:35,736
She is from our village!

215
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:37,768
She is

216
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,274

Aunt has started this Hermitage for
girls like you!

220
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:48,604
Yes child

221
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,856
Girls learn to sing and
dance here!

222
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:53,753
Do you know how to sing?

223
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,244
She has a very sweet voice!

224
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,125
Her father was a well known singer

225
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,305
Really?
He has only trained her!

226
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,306
Let the master come...

227
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,122
...only he can test her voice!

228
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,439
Okay aunty when should I come?

229
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:07,907
Come after a week!

230
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,879
Okay I am leaving

231
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,650
I'll have to stay here uncle?

232
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,466
Yes

233
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,836
Consider her like your mother...

234
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,358
....if you listen to her and
keep her happy....

235
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,867
...then you'll be more than happy!

236
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,356

238
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:26,828
Aunty take her away!

239
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,072
Come child, feel homely!

240
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,288
Welcome Sir, you are coming
here after a long time!

241
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:17,768
Babuji, Should I take you to the
real charm of this lane?

242
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,307
To Munni!

243
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:21,167
C'mon!
Go away

244
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,366
Cant you see he is educated!

245
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,375
Take someone else!

246
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,630
Babuji, come!

247
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,441
You must have heard Krishna's name!

248
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,194
C'mon!
Dont touch me!

249
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,092
You have got me to this dirty place?

250
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,247
Babuji, if a travellor tells me to take him
anywhere at this hour...

251
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:41,481
...I ought to get him here!

252
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,662
Lets go back

253
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:47,318
"The night is passing but Krishna does not come..."

254
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:57,722
"The night is passing but Krishna does not come..."

255
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:03,772
"I get no sleep"

256
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:08,204
"I get no sleep"

257
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:19,792
"The night is passing but Krishna does not come..."

258
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,505
"The night is passing"

259
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,025
Anand Babu

260
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,615
Welcome Anand Babu, you and

261
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:32,652
Dint you recognize me?

262
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:40,141
Please sing

263
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,043
Why did you stop?

264
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,070
Please sing

265
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,534
Sing

266
00:17:56,004 --> 00:18:05,410
"Krishna forgot his promise..."

267
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:15,617
"Krishna forgot his promise..."

268
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:26,803
"Radha sits with her lamp, in wait for him."

269
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:36,204
"I get no sleep"

270
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:47,816
"The night is passing but Krishna does not come..."

271
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:50,975
"The night is passing"

272
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:13,321
"The blow of the lament makes the lover mad..."

273
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:23,091
"The blow of the lament makes the lover mad..."

274
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:34,267
"The heart and body are thirsty;
tears in the eyes."

275
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:38,771
"I get no sleep"

276
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,501
"I get no sleep"

277
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:54,380
"The night is passing but Krishna does not come..."

278
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,886
"The night is passing"

279
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:04,510
You turned this room
into a temple!

280
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,746
Whoever you are, your voice can
take a man's pain away from him!

281
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:16,393
You heard that?

282
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,767
He praised her so well!

283
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:20,501
Do you know who is he?

284
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,546
He is one of the those wealthy people
of the city!

285
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:24,761
I have old relations
with him!

286
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,277
Really? She is really fortuitous!

287
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,519
She sang for the first time and
Anand Babu came here!

288
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:32,818
I havent come....

289
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,997
....the magic in her voice pulled
me here!

290
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,123
Keep visiting us everyday, Anand Babu!

291
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,585
Pushpa's house is your house!

292
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:47,747
Your name is Pushpa?

293
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,926
Should have been Meera!

294
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:07,278
Please have this!

295
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:11,421
Mahesh brother will forget his first
wife seeing your red lips!

296
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:14,682
Oh child...

297
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,201
Go to your new mother!

298
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,352
Come!

299
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:38,342
Nandu, come here quickly

300
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,926
Nalu, look at this nest!

301
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,830
I'll place it on a branch!

302
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:48,231
Why will you place it
on a branch?

303
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:53,144
On a full moon day, a bird's mother will
keep 3 eggs in it...

304
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,523
....and we'll play with her kids!

305
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,331
On a full moon day?
-Yes

306
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:00,284
I wont be here till then!
-Why?

307
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:01,354
Where are you going?

308
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,206
Calcutta! My new mother has
said now we'll stay there!

309
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,021
You'll wont come back to the village?

310
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:08,393
No, my father is seeing a place!

311
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,082
As and when we get a place
we all will shift there!

312
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,408
The house is good

313
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,683
But if you could compromise
a bit on the rent?

314
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,050
I am sorry!

315
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,733
This same house in some area would
have double rent!

316
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:22,890
You are also getting ready
furniture!

317
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:24,248
As you wish

318
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:25,351
When are you all coming?

319
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:26,206
On the 1st!

320
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,390
Advance of 2 months!

321
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,256
Yes, why not

322
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,384
Take this

323
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,920
Thank you, and even your receipt is ready!

324
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:38,045
OkaY Greetings!

325
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,022
Mahesh Brother!

326
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,523
You?
Did not recognize me?

327
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,806
I am Pushpa

328
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:15,948
Who Pushpa?

329
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,383
Excellent, you have forgotten me?

330
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:21,521
You forgot your sister?

331
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,190
Remember I had asked you for
a job once?

332
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,844
I recollected!

333
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,728
But what are you doing?

334
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,202
Come inside!

335
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,443
You'll get wet in the rains!

336
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:35,225
no, I am in a hurry!

337
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,709
Let rains stop

338
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,228
Come

339
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:42,991
Come in

340
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,594
Everybody is fine at home?

341
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,198
Yes

342
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,661
Your son Nandu?

343
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:51,581
He must have grown till now?

344
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,869
Yes

345
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:53,512
Sit

346
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:54,469
I'll just come!

347
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:18,317
You are still standing?

348
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:19,486
Sit

349
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:20,290
Have this sweet!

350
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:23,112
No, I wont have anything!

351
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,311
How is that possible?

352
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:27,974
I have met you after so long...

353
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,578
...I cant go without serving!
No, No Pushpa

354
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:31,654
I am getting late!

355
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,092
The rains have reduced

356
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,863
I have to catch the evening train!

357
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,129
You are going back to
the village?

358
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:37,308
Yes

359
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:38,826
Wait for a minute

360
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,057
Please give 50 rupees to my mother!

361
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,237
To your mother?

362
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:56,883
Yes

363
00:24:57,717 --> 00:24:59,603
I am really worried about her

364
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,929
So whenever possible...

365
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:04,010
....I keep sending her things!

366
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:06,485
Whom do you send it with?

367
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:10,419
Through Nepal babu...

368
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,942
....because of him I am here today!

369
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,934
I keep sending things through
him!

370
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:22,062
I cant face anyone from the village!

371
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:26,008
Take this and give it to my
mother!

372
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:30,823
Take this!

373
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:31,692
You keep the money

374
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,296
Pushpa

375
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,204
Sorry, I think I have come on
a wrong time!

376
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:39,100
No, he is my brother!
from my village!

377
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:40,772
Mahesh Brother!

378
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:45,115
Sorry but seeing money...

379
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:46,800
....I was mistakened!

380
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,870
This is Pushpa's money

381
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,759
I was sending it for my mother!

382
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:53,556
Yes I remember....

383
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,944
...very often you send
money to your mother!

384
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,653
Keep them

385
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:00,319
Now dont send it!

386
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:01,951
Why?

387
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:05,365
Because your mother has passed away!

388
00:26:06,926 --> 00:26:07,636
What?

389
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:11,929
No one informed me!

390
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:16,384
Pushpa, you have expired for the villagers!

391
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:20,941
Who'll inform you if you
dont exist for them!

392
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,274
Okay I am leaving

393
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:28,695
Greetings

394
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,434
Dont cry Pushpa...

395
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:58,417
....whatever you are and wherever you are...

396
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:04,796
....your tears are just like saline water

397
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:09,366
Wipe them Pushpa
I hate tears

398
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:15,118
Yes

399
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:17,442
You are right Anand Babu!

400
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:19,217
You are right!

401
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,498
Sit

402
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:34,395
Take this!

403
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:36,941
Let it be

404
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,752
Lets go out somewhere

405
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:41,362
Where?

406
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,999
Some place...

407
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,622
...just for sometime...

408
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:47,949

He'll become very fair

Put it

447
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,944
Kamla, I am going to the market
to get some stuffs

448
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:29,643
Remove my clothes and keep

449
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:31,091
Once I come will immediately
go to the office

450
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:34,202
Okay
Father, even I want to come along with you!

451
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:35,932
No, you have to go to the school!

452
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:40,447
Take him along, he'll see the shop
and if I want something he'll get it!

453
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:41,821
Eat son!
C'mon!

454
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:47,086
My sweet child!

455
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:55,030
Pushpa, last night you were fighting
with your Babu?

456
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:56,843
What for?

457
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,289
He was drunk....

458
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,016
...so I had to forcibly send
him home!

459
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,992
Aunty, welcome!

460
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:04,794
Surprising!

461
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,207
What else can he do besides
fighting with you!

462
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:09,571
Sometimes he even does
that!

463
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:14,340
Whatever it is, whether you feel
good or bad!

464
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,400
If you upset him, you'll suffer
for the rest of your life!

465
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:19,334
Dont give me a lecture
in mornings!

466
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:20,809
Take this!

467
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,092

469
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:27,742
I never have to tell you
anything for money?

470
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:29,870
So girls....

471
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,945
...there was a lot of noise
coming from your houses!

472
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:34,947
We have kept your money...

473
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:35,787
...come and take it!

474
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,835
Lets go

475
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:40,024
Oh ho Did you see that?

476
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,416
They behave like I beg in front of them!

477
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,486
They waste money on cosmetics...

478
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:48,778
...and when they have to give me money
its

479
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:49,783
I'll just go and ask them!

480
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:56,835
Our house is here!

481
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:58,900
Nandu, dont run you'll
fall!

482
00:34:58,936 --> 00:34:59,985
Hey!

483
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:03,175
You called me?

484
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,647
Yes, who stay here?

485
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:08,456
You bought that empty flat?

486
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:10,569
Lets go father!

487
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,778
Is he Nandu?

488
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,410
He has grown so big

489
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:16,536
I had seen him when he was a child!

490
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:19,277
Nandu take this bag and go home!

491
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:20,231
I am just coming

492
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,711
He has grown old

493
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,534
Look Pushpa!

494
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:26,536
Dont talk to me after today

495
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:28,841
Why brother?

496
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,062
Because the area you stay in...

497
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:33,438
.....is not acceptable by the society!

498
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:35,168
And I stay in the society

499
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:40,195
I can be defamed if I talk to you
or meet you!

500
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,181
So I dont want anyone to know
that we know each other

501
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:02,210
What is it?
Why are you peeping in?

502
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,062
Naughty, its you?

503
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,403
Nandu, listen to me!

504
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,239
Open the door!

505
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,846
Shankar,what happen?

506
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,727
She is not opening the door

507
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:25,212
What happen?
What is this noise for?

508
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,115
Something happened!
-What happen?

509
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:30,197
Shankar is stading with a knife
outside Durga's room!

510
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:31,411
And she is not opening the door

511
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:32,483
And where is aunty?

512
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:33,955
Aunty has gone out somewhere
with her father

513
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,574
Shankar is drunk he might
kill her!

514
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:39,319
7 murders are excused in that state!
Lets see!-No

515
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,789
I wont let you go there

516
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:42,770
Shankar is a very dangerous man

517
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:46,548
Sometimes you have to take risks in life!

518
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:47,914
There is no spice left otherwise

519
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,064
Lets go

520
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:59,885
Red eyes, with a knife in your hand and
poses like Lord Shiva

521
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,408
How did you come here?

522
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:05,489
What?
Just give me this knife

523
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:07,627
Atleast give it to me!

524
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:11,722
This is so small!

525
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,374
Where is your spearhead?

526
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,807
What nonsense are you talking?

527
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:18,419
Dint understand?
No

528
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:21,893
Your name is Shankar
and you are innocent

529
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:26,320
.....and you have misunderstood this Concubinary
as your wife....

530
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,458
...who'll come running and will open the door!

531
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:33,672
Now you tell me how would you taste
any syrup while drinking beer!

532
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,145
What are you saying?

533
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,075
Durga

534
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:42,701
Open the door Durga

535
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:44,299
Anand Babu has come here

536
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,820
Dont get scared

537
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,829
Not at all

538
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:49,444
Is anyone there inside?

539
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,183
Then why werent you opening the door?

540
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,685
My child is suffering from fever...

541
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,957
...he wasnt leaving me!

542
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:03,150
Babuji, have mercy on me and
please ask him to leave!

543
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:05,194
Understood

544
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,535
Understood!
That bitch closed the door?

545
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,398
Inspite of hearing this you are still high?

546
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:15,483
This child that is suffering from fever
is your child?

547
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:16,935
Mine?
No!

548
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:18,894
I am not his father

549
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:21,649
Durga belongs to you then who so ever
may be the father!

550
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:22,637
Yes thats there!

551
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,196
Her child also belongs to you!

552
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,625
Yes

553
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:30,163
If you love her go and call a doctor,
her child is not keeping well!

554
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:31,471
Doctor?

555
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:32,609
Durga is not well?

556
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,799
I'll just go and get a doctor!

557
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:39,276
Shankarji!-Yes!
Take your bribe!

558
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:42,522
Durga is not keeping well!

559
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,013
The fight is over!

560
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:45,864
Pushpa...

561
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,870
...will I get little?

562
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,357
I was scared, if something
would have happened to you!

563
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:00,433
What has to happen will
happen!

564
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:04,461
Every man should get a chance
to show his qualities!

565
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,839
Dint you see how I became
a hero outside?

566
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:11,801
All the fun has died, just prepare
one more glass!

567
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:15,636
Pushpa

568
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:19,200
Anand Babu!

569
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:20,346
Greetings!

570
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:23,266
I am sorry, I came at a wrong time!

571
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:25,753
Dont feel bad

572
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,681
What are you saying gentleman?

573
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:33,405
What inopportune time for you?

574
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,823
You are the owner

575
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:41,753
Afterall you have done this good job
of getting this decent girl here!

576
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,142
Had you not been there...

577
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:47,698
....who would blossom this flower
in this garden!

578
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:53,287
Anand babu, you are embarrassing me

579
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:54,347
Really?

580
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:55,741
I wont wait for a longer time!

581
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,840
Pushpa, I am going to the village
tomorrow!

582
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,995
Your mother had asked for more
50 rupees last time!

583
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:07,269
My Mother?

584
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:10,090
Nepal Babu

585
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:10,804
Yes

586
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,477
Sometimes even a cow raises its head
while eating grass!

587
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:18,626
May be to thank god!

588
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:22,830
But I dont think
you would ever raise your head, Isnt it?

589
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:27,725
The one who sits above us...

590
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,542
....arent you scared of him?

591
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:33,005
I dint understand anything!

592
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:33,932
You did not understand?

593
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,194
C'mon outside!
I'll explain you!

594
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:42,964
Pushpa knows...

595
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:44,228
What does she know?

596
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,198
Everyone staying here also know it!

597
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:47,259
What?

598
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:49,610
That her mother has passed away!

599
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:52,927
So drop the curtains...

600
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,611
....the show is over!

601
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,293
Where are you off to Nepal Babu?

602
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:03,281
Take it!
No

603
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:04,829
Take it gentleman

604
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:10,237
All this time you had no shame
then why today?

605
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,480
Till you are alive live a life
this way!

606
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:16,395
Leave Nepal Babu!

607
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:17,209
Go

608
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:33,305
Hey Nandu

609
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:35,750
Are you coming from the school?
-Yes

610
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,444
My New mother!
What is it?

611
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:48,663
Give me good!
After sometime!

612
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:50,142
I am very hungry...

613
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:50,792
....new mother

614
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,578
I told you come after sometime!

615
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:53,808
Wont you take a bath, brother?

616
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:55,543
Yes, go and take a bath first

617
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,878
I'll take a bath in the lake opposite
our house!

618
00:42:58,357 --> 00:42:59,851
Go wherever you want and
dont eat my head! Go!

619
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:03,940
Mother I am hungry!

620
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,121
I'll serve you right now!
Come to me

621
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,656
You are hungry?

622
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:23,471
New mother, I took a bath...

623
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,444
...now please serve me!

624
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:26,411
Cant you see I am boiling clothes!

625
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:27,766
Cant you wait?

626
00:43:28,598 --> 00:43:30,925
Give me anything to eat
I am very hungry!

627
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:34,881
I'll slap you, I asked you to wait for
sometime, are you going from here?

628
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:40,137
Is my darling son more hungry?

629
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,031
Yes son?

630
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:42,780
Take this! Eat it!

631
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:21,970
What happen?

632
00:44:22,152 --> 00:44:23,260
What did you break?

633
00:44:26,365 --> 00:44:27,763
What happen?
What did you break?

634
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:30,595
How did this break?

635
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,173
Give me an answer

636
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:33,105

637
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:34,952
Give me an answer!
Why are you quite?

638
00:44:35,026 --> 00:44:36,940
You learnt to steal now?

639
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,486
What are you looking at me,
get down!

640
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:43,922
Punk, scoundrel, cheeky!

641
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,247
You have started stealing

642
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,556
I'll hit you if you again step
in this room!

643
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,326
Go away from here!

644
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,544
Nandu, why are you sitting here?

645
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:32,574
Its so late, wont you
go home?

646
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:35,222
No, my new mother hits me!

647
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:36,468
Why?

648
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:39,060
I broke the bottle of pickles!

649
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:41,047
I was very hungry

650
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,912
You havent eaten food as yet?

651
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:46,369
Dont cry

652
00:45:46,902 --> 00:45:47,901
Eat

653
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,067
Sweet

654
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:50,240
Eat your mouth

655
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:54,201
Now whenever you are hungry
come to me

656
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:55,202
Will you come?

657
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,290
But dont tell anybody

658
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:01,003
And now dont cry

659
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,289
A good boy never cries

660
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,459
Say

661
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:06,354

662
00:46:12,425 --> 00:46:13,320

00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:15,302
Excellent

664
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:17,774
Your dress is very nice!

665
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:19,181
Your father got it for you?

666
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:20,094
Yes

667
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:23,010
Whom are these Samosa (fried or baked pastry) made for?
-No

668
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,180
Dont touch it!
Say

669
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:26,415
They are stale ones!

670
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,529
I love Samosa (fried or baked pastry)

671
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:29,616
Really?

Not even a single work done!

00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:32,813
No, Work was done...

698

..atleast I came to know the man who
just left from here was a scoundrel!

699
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:40,047
Exactly he is a rascal!

00:47:40,653 --> 00:47:41,587
Anyway leave all that...

701
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:43,226

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,181
What is all this?
Our servant cant see all this?

712
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,325
He doesnt do anything

713
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:19,079

And when I call you,

718
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:32,574
How do I answer when my name is Hariraam
and you call Balraam!

719
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,103
Yes I forgot!

00:48:34,718 --> 00:48:35,524
Hariraam ji!

721
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,215
Balraam was your elder brother!

722
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:39,709
He was a very nice man!

723
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:43,301
He was a strong man and people
were scared of him!

724
00:48:43,913 --> 00:48:48,120
And when evening falls he had a habit
of drinking just like me!

725
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:49,187
Understood Balraam?

726
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:51,935
Its Hariraam Sir!
Oh yes sorry!

727

Where are my slippers?

734
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:10,045
Your pyjama is wet!

735
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,880

not dried up!

736
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:16,279

You'll eat?

844
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:19,451
I wont let you have till

845
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:21,833
I'll make something quickly!

846
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:27,261
Listen

847
00:55:29,938 --> 00:55:31,480
Do you know how to make puris
(bread fried in oil)

848
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,472
Puri?

849
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:34,093
Potato Vegetable!

850
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:35,690
Hot pudding

851
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,467
Do you know how to make it?

852
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:40,156
You'll eat all of this?

853
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:42,174
Definitely!

854
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,357
If you sit next to me and make

I'll just get!

856
00:55:58,445 --> 00:55:59,907
Mother has sent clothes for washing!

857
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:00,811
Keep it here

858
00:56:02,587 --> 00:56:03,531
And these are my father's clothes....

859
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:04,841
....iron them and send them by tomorrow morning!

860
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:05,760
Okay

861
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:08,367
Greetings!

862
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,849
Natwarlalji!

863
00:56:25,056 --> 00:56:28,136
Newspaper is for reading news and
you are hiding your face behind it?

864
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:31,134
Anand Babu, theres some problem!

865
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:31,792
Problem?

866
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,738
One Pathan is finding me!

867
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:37,524
He recoginized me!

868
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:41,548
I thought you are hiding from me!

869
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:46,529
We are different sides of
the same coin!

870
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:52,118
I am totally unashamed of coming
to this place!

871
00:56:53,486 --> 00:56:54,189
I am leaving

872
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:55,737
What is the hurry?

873
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:59,212
Anand Babu, those two sweet and innocent
girls...

874
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,530
..they are waiting for you?

875
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:02,868
Leave

876
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,627
Why did you take so long?

877
00:57:21,173 --> 00:57:22,778
My new mother had sent me
to the washerman!

878
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:25,120
You'll eat samosas?

879
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:25,929
I'll heat it?
-Yes

880
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,690
I'll just get it

881
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:35,598
Have!

882
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,168
Who is he?

883
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,267
He is Nandu

884
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:40,066
You had met my brother, right?

885
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:41,546
His eldest son!

886
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:42,807
He stays opposite us!

887
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,944
He really likes Samosas?

888
00:57:46,535 --> 00:57:47,005
Yes

889
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:47,997
Take some more

890
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:51,925
Okay, Now you leave and come
tomorrow

891
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:53,682
Tomorrow also you'll give
me these?

892
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,336
Yes definitely!

893
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:56,959
Now go

894
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:05,424
You really love him!

895
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,591
Anand babu

896
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:13,060
How many children you have?

897
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,277
I dont have

898
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,652
And wife?

899
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,370
I have one!

900
00:58:23,152 --> 00:58:25,287
She is a very decent woman!

901
00:58:26,344 --> 00:58:31,550
Why do you leave her alone
at home and come here

902
00:58:33,121 --> 00:58:34,222
You are a decent man!

903
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:35,717
Pushpa

904
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,140
A man can be decent...

905
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:40,681
....as well as indecent

906
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:46,229
I come here to see the devil within me!

907
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:51,755
Do you really come here
for this?

908
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,001
Should I ask you something Pushpa?

909
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,395
You are a defamed woman

910
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:02,531
Then why does Nandu, a boy
from a decent family, come here?

911
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,255
Thats a different story

912
00:59:04,977 --> 00:59:06,246
He has a step mother...

913
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:07,941
....she doesnt like him!

914
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:12,026
No one likes me!

915
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:13,808
Dont say this

916
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,764
And so I come here

917
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:19,434
Dont ask me this ever again!

918
00:59:23,087 --> 00:59:23,853
Have water

919
00:59:28,588 --> 00:59:29,570
From where did you get
this samosa from?

920
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,584
From there!

921
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,290
From where?

922
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:34,359
She stays opposite us!

923
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:35,406
She gave me

924
00:59:35,897 --> 00:59:38,887
Very bad, punk, shameless,
why did you go there?

925
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:40,681
Throw it

926
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,976
You eat what she gives?

927
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:45,230
Useless!

928
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,321
Why, whats wrong with her?

929
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,483
No need for you to
know that!

930
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:52,121
I'll break your legs if
you again go to her place!

931
00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:53,938
Munni, you stay with him

932
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:54,650
C'mon Raju

933
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,475
Ashok Kumar has acted so well
in Sanghram!

934
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:00,940
I am a fan of Dev Anand

935
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:04,419
I watched Waaji and he came
to my dreams for continuous 3 nights

936
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,596
Dev Anand and Ashok Kumar have become
actors...

937
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,425
.....and the foolish guy who....

938
01:00:12,918 --> 01:00:14,492
....buys a ticket of Balcony...

939
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:16,337
...he has no value?

940
01:00:16,786 --> 01:00:18,398
You became upset without
any reason

941
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:19,694
Then what?

942
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,782
You are the real hero!

943
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:23,115
Natwarlalji...

944
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:26,666
.....today if you would have
bumped into your wife in the theatre then?

945
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:28,994
How would I bump into her?

946
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:31,239
My work is not poor

947
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:35,929
People like us keep an eye on our wives!

948
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:37,935
Then what about them?

949
01:00:38,238 --> 01:00:39,996
We see them through glasses!

950
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:42,684
What about us?

951
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:45,386
Goggles on you!

952
01:00:45,906 --> 01:00:47,864
The glasses that you wear...

953
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:49,379
...under the sun that doesnt damage
your eye!

954
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,167
He is caught

955
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:51,654
Who is caught?

956
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,425
You!
Khan Sir

957
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,258
You have come here to listen
to songs?

958
01:00:58,592 --> 01:01:01,271
Shut up, where is my money?

959
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,520
You'll get it

960
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,110
Meet these girls first

961
01:01:04,144 --> 01:01:06,320
She is Pyaari and she
is Dulhari!

962
01:01:06,336 --> 01:01:10,191
You'll get flattered
seeing their dance!

963
01:01:11,894 --> 01:01:13,892
You have broken my trust!

964
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:15,718
Its been 3 months....

965
01:01:16,164 --> 01:01:17,586
...I havent got my money

966
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,666
I dont know where were you?
Today I'll take the money and will go!

967
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:23,076
Very Sorry Khan saab, I cant
pay you today!

968
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,989
You come on Monday...

969
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:27,938
....we dont give money on Mondays!

970
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:30,809
Okay, I'll spare you today...

971
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:32,515
...I'll come to your place
tomorrow in the morning!

972
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:33,999
Definitely!

973
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:37,286
If you will not come tomorrow morning,
I'll come to you!

974
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:38,760
I'll definitely come tomorrow!

975
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:40,251
And I'll take my money from you

976
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,211
Natwarlalji!
-Yes!

977
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:46,400
You borrow money from Pathans?

978
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,233
I have to borrow!

979
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:52,604
We have to borrow money
before coming to your houses!

980
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:53,555
You joke a lot

981
01:01:54,164 --> 01:01:55,801
Pyaali will you eat Panipuri
(street snack in India)?

982
01:01:56,278 --> 01:01:57,100
Panipuri?

983
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,617
Yes, treat us with panipuri!

984
01:01:59,046 --> 01:02:01,364
Now dont insist so much
I have just showed you'll a movie!

985
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:02,041
So what?

986
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,649
You like us, isnt it?

987
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:07,152
I'll like you more if you
cut down your costs!

988
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:08,647
We'll hardly eat anything

989
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:10,057
C'mon

990
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:13,043
Make one plate of panipuri!

991
01:02:16,156 --> 01:02:17,034
Make!

992
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:31,356
You are only serving them!
Serve me also!

993
01:02:31,854 --> 01:02:34,524
I have to pay money!
Give me! No!

994
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,242
Dont put Tamarind water in it!

995
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:40,163
I have got water, put this!

996
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:42,156
I myself will put water

997
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:43,374
Its Palidhar's water

998
01:03:11,262 --> 01:03:12,341
Give me more

999
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:14,188
Its over!

1000
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,260
Its over? No problem

1001
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:26,403
Even my water is over!

1002
01:03:28,155 --> 01:03:29,513
How much?

1003
01:03:29,564 --> 01:03:30,473
15 rupees Sir

1004
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:31,524
15 Rupees?

1005
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:33,982
No problem take it

1006
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:37,663
My pocket is torn!

1007
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:39,590
Whether someone has robbed it or
your pocket is torn you will have to pay!

1008
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:42,298

1009
01:03:42,963 --> 01:03:45,506
Do you have anything in your purse?

1010
01:03:47,966 --> 01:03:48,731
Its empty

1011

Bindu, take this!

1014
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:56,462

01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:57,527
I dont drink!

1016
01:03:57,913 --> 01:03:59,934
Who is asking you to drink?

1017
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:02,371
I have kept it on Mortgage!

1018
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:05,827
I'll come tomorrow give you your money
and take this back!

1019
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:18,110
Pushpa

1020
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:23,246
Look I got Kachoris along with
Samosas!

1021
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,813
Where is your son?

1022
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:30,106
Are you joking?

1023
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,452
Pushpa you are joking!

1024
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:38,050
With yourself!

1025
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:43,101
I should get for you?

1026
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:45,709
No, Later!

1027
01:04:46,217 --> 01:04:48,136
Make him have for whom I have
got!

1028
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,280
He has still not come?

1029
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:54,017
No

1030
01:05:05,323 --> 01:05:08,731
I'll tell mother you are going there!

1031
01:05:09,554 --> 01:05:11,247
Mother he is again going!

1032
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:13,243
Nandu, again you are going there!

1033
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:16,003
God knows what has that bitch done to you?

1034
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,508
She is totally shameless....

1035
01:05:18,842 --> 01:05:20,161
....she even spoils children!

1036
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:21,499
C'mon in!

1037
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:25,170
What are you looking there,
C'mon in!

1038
01:05:31,006 --> 01:05:32,211
I am fed up!

1039
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:35,257
This child has made my
life miserable!

1040
01:05:36,238 --> 01:05:39,349
What happen atleast tell me!

1041
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,565
Again you are crying?

1042
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:49,172
How many times have I told you Pushpa...

1043
01:05:49,214 --> 01:05:50,440
...I hate tears!

1044
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:57,992
You are running towards darkness!

1045
01:05:59,116 --> 01:06:01,578
Your thirst wont quench
and you'll drown!

1046
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:07,043
Whats left in my life now?

1047
01:06:09,027 --> 01:06:13,137
Anand Babu wouldnt have existed
if nothing was left in your life!

1048
01:06:14,123 --> 01:06:16,321
He wouldnt have given
you money every month!

1049
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:19,127
He wouldnt have beautified you!

1050
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:21,591
Truthfully...

1051
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,322
...I had never thought

1052
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,243
I'll love Nandu so much!

1053
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:31,169
Like every woman I had dreamt of...

1054
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,471
...my own house!

1055
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:38,141
I'll have a husband, children...

1056
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:41,768
But nothing happened!

1057
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:44,406
Nothing came true

1058
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:49,637
Gentleman, arent you ashamed of staying with
your wife in this area?

1059
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:53,874
I have to hide my face and walk from
this area!

1060
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,099
You can still hide your face...

1061
01:06:56,205 --> 01:06:57,072
...but what should I do?

1062
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,362
Because of these women I cant
even leave the house!

1063
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:00,384
Dont worry!

1064
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:09,485
"People will say things"

1065
01:07:10,215 --> 01:07:14,010

1084

1085
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:22,848
"We ve come secretly and silently and

1086

No Laxmi, I dont want to stay here
anymore!

1093
01:11:18,272 --> 01:11:19,708
Where else will you go?

1094
01:11:20,227 --> 01:11:22,578
Where ever you'll go, people
ought to defame you!

1095
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,181
I have asked him to find a flat
in a decent area!

1096
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,839
Yes, Anand Babu is wealthy...

1097
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,531
...if he wants he can buy one!
Excuse me!

1098
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:34,059
Anyone named Pushpa lives here?

1099
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,009
I am Pushpa

1100
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:40,046
I want to tell you something

1101
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:41,177

1102
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:43,190
Here?

1103
01:11:44,389 --> 01:11:45,171
Where do you live?

1104
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:48,462
Come

1105
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:55,456
This is my room!

1106
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,051
Sit

1107
01:11:58,161 --> 01:11:59,055
Anand babu comes here?

1108
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,347
Who are you?

1109
01:12:01,377 --> 01:12:02,200
He comes or no?

1110
01:12:02,662 --> 01:12:03,420
Answer to me!

1111
01:12:03,929 --> 01:12:05,440
Please be polite

1112
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:08,844
I dont even know you!

1113
01:12:08,886 --> 01:12:09,816
Anand Babu is my brother in law

1114
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:11,650
And my sister doesnt want him
to come here!

1115
01:12:13,339 --> 01:12:14,833
Why does your sister allow him
to come here?

1116
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:16,022
Forcibly he comes here!

1117
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,635
When your sister cannot stop him...

1118
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:20,049
Look I dont want to argue with you!

1119
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,165
Understood?

1120
01:12:21,215 --> 01:12:23,737
If my brother in law comes here
please ask him to leave!

1121
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,894
What is the use of my refusal?

1122
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:31,020
Can you stop him?

1123
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:34,642
I am not alone in this big
city!

1124
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:36,986
I dont care if you are staying alone
or with somebody!

1125
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:39,525
Just stop him from coming here!

1126
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:40,709
Thats it

1127
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,031
I cannot refuse him!

1128
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:45,707
Why dont you tell him you are at a loss!

1129
01:12:46,552 --> 01:12:48,526
You dont have a brother or a son!

1130
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,153
How will you understand my sister's
sorrow?

1131
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,853
You can only see money!

1132
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:56,925
Why are you talking nonsense!

1133
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:57,873
Who are you?

1134
01:12:58,271 --> 01:12:59,117
I am Anand Babu's relative!

1135
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:01,250
So why have you come here?

1136
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:02,452
Mind ur language

1137
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:03,643
You mind ur language

1138
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:05,933
You come to my place and
boss over us!

1139
01:13:06,225 --> 01:13:06,783
Leave from here

1140
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,555
Leave

1141
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:09,802
Aunty what are you doing?

1142
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:13,728
You can leave

1143
01:13:14,271 --> 01:13:15,742
I promise you...

1144
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,044
...Anand Babu will never come
here back again!

1145
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,639
Thank you for that

1146
01:13:22,992 --> 01:13:24,613
Pushpa what did you do?

1147
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:26,880
You'll leave Anand Babu just
because he said?

1148
01:13:28,323 --> 01:13:31,106
I became strong the day....

1149
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:33,387
.....I had come here!

1150
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:34,986
Then why this foolishness?

1151
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:37,981
Foolishness?

1152
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:42,490
You wont understand that!

1153
01:14:09,974 --> 01:14:10,717
Why are you crying?

1154
01:14:11,596 --> 01:14:12,818
For you

1155
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:14,783
Why dint you come yesterday?

1156
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:18,470
My father and my new mother,
stop me from coming here!

1157
01:14:18,796 --> 01:14:20,826
They say bad people come
to your place!

1158
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:23,966
Now nobody will come!

1159
01:14:25,283 --> 01:14:27,369
From today I wont let anyone
come except for you!!

1160
01:14:28,142 --> 01:14:28,980
Wont let anyone come!

1161
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:51,598
Pushpa why is this door closed today?

1162
01:14:53,045 --> 01:14:53,757
Open the door

1163
01:14:55,664 --> 01:14:59,846
Your beloved is standing at the door
please open this closed door!

1164
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:01,686
Why are you taking so long
today?

1165
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:03,459
Open the door

1166
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:05,984
Pushpa!

1167
01:15:08,994 --> 01:15:10,327
Go away from here Anand Babu!

1168
01:15:11,922 --> 01:15:12,615
I should go away?

1169
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:14,073
Why?

1170
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:17,652
Dont ever come back again!

1171
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:20,127
What has happened to you
all of a sudden?

1172
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:25,935
Atleast open the door

1173
01:15:27,046 --> 01:15:27,724
Pushpa

1174
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:34,682
No, you return back

1175
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:36,963
Back to your wife!

1176
01:15:38,594 --> 01:15:42,614
You are sending me to the person
I leave and come!

1177
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:45,466
I dont come to go back!

1178
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,698
Then you keep standing outside!

1179
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:20,942
You are on the road and
the door is closed?

1180
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:23,764
There is a festival today?

1181
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:28,230
The roads are very crowded and
outside every room there is a que!

1182
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:30,657
Which que are you standing in!

1183
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,214
I dont believe in ques!

1184
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:37,414
I believe if one door is closed
enter in the next room!

1185
01:16:38,236 --> 01:16:42,227
Thats why I love 2 females!

1186
01:16:42,753 --> 01:16:44,414
If Pyaari is not available,
Dulhari is there!

1187
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:45,649
Come!

1188
01:16:45,654 --> 01:16:46,531
With you?

1189
01:16:47,614 --> 01:16:51,795
Dont worry, I have this with me!

1190
01:16:52,253 --> 01:16:53,452
Its Indian!

1191
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:56,850
Anand Babu, sometimes you should
also enjoy Indian one!

1192
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:58,083
Come On!

1193
01:16:58,782 --> 01:16:59,595
Hey Anand Babu

1194
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,419
Keep your left leg forward!

1195
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:04,239
Left?

1196
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:05,683
Okay

1197
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,531
Pyaari, Dulhaari!

1198
01:17:14,222 --> 01:17:17,884
Look whose here!

1199
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:18,560
Anand babu, you?

1200
01:17:18,988 --> 01:17:20,410
We've been lucky today!

1201
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:22,387
Early morning whose face did we see?

1202
01:17:22,783 --> 01:17:25,326
You saw my face, you have
forgotten?

1203
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:27,800
A curse like you!

1204
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:29,224
Come in Anand Babu

1205
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,670
Have a seat

1206
01:17:30,704 --> 01:17:32,197
Sit!

1207
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:35,681
I got you here and they are serving you!

1208
01:17:36,143 --> 01:17:37,286
Sit

1209
01:17:38,809 --> 01:17:42,895
Fill 1 to 2 glasses for Anand Babu
and for me!

1210
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:52,864
Anand Babu

1211
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,918
Why are you silent?

1212
01:17:55,935 --> 01:17:56,853
Why are you sad?

1213
01:17:57,402 --> 01:17:58,289
Nothing happen

1214
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,583
Dont lie to me, you are sad!

1215
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:02,831
Say

1216
01:18:04,437 --> 01:18:06,931
Natwarlalji
What should I tell you?

1217
01:18:07,318 --> 01:18:09,413
Tell me what happen?

1218
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:11,080
Should I?

1219
01:18:11,576 --> 01:18:13,909
"What happened?"

1220
01:18:15,049 --> 01:18:16,479
"How did it happen?"

1221
01:18:18,075 --> 01:18:19,552
"When did it happen?"

1222
01:18:20,983 --> 01:18:21,557
Now what more?

1223
01:18:23,206 --> 01:18:25,734
"What happened?"

1224
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:27,813
"How did it happen?"

1225

"When it had to happen, it happened"

1228
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:41,202
"let it go don t think about what happened"

1229
01:18:44,029 --> 01:18:45,307
"What happened?"

1230
01:18:46,868 --> 01:18:47,753
"How did it happen?"

1231
01:18:48,661 --> 01:18:50,611
"When did it happen?"

1232
01:18:51,157 --> 01:18:52,171
"Why did it happen?"

1233
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:56,355
"When it had to happen, it happened"

1234
01:18:57,707 --> 01:19:01,025
"let it go don t think about what happened"

1235
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,089
"What happened?"

1236
01:19:24,575 --> 01:19:31,061
"Why should I complain...."

1237
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,622
".....because of
which broke my heart?"

1238
01:19:35,686 --> 01:19:41,522
"Why should I complain...."

1239
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:45,231
".....because of
which broke my heart?"

1240
01:19:47,452 --> 01:19:50,587
"It was like a glass"

1241
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,430
"Something had to happen"

1242
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,399
"What happened?"

1243
01:19:58,764 --> 01:19:59,930
"How did it happen?"

1244
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,604
"When did it happen?"

1245
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:04,403
"Why did it happen?"

1246
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:08,458

01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:17,267
"What happened?"

1249
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:19,627
Understood?

1250

what I had heard...."

1251
01:20:35,616 --> 01:20:38,511
"....how do I explain what it was"

1252
01:20:39,354 --> 01:20:44,879
"what I had seen and
what I had heard...."

1253
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,413
".....how do I explain what it was"

1254
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:56,802
"It was a beautiful dream it
had to end and it happened"

1255
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:01,679

"What happened?"

1261
01:21:35,688 --> 01:21:42,206
"My heart swings after a drink"

1262
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:45,991
"It roams in these lanes"

1263
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:52,835
"My heart swings after a drink"

1264
01:21:53,738 --> 01:21:56,762
"It roams in these lanes"

1265
01:21:58,222 --> 01:22:04,404
"You had to loose yourself here
and get defamed"

1266
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:08,788
"What happened?"

1267
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:11,195
"How did it happen?"

1268
01:22:11,987 --> 01:22:13,881

01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:15,660

1272
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,218
"What happened?"

1273
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,745
Come in Sir!

1274
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,270
What is the time?

1275
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:42,245
Its 2 o clock

1276
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:43,466
Its 2 o clock?

1277
01:22:46,558 --> 01:22:48,189
You havent slept as yet?

1278
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:51,207
No Sir, Even madam has not returned
as yet!

1279
01:22:54,072 --> 01:22:59,446
When your Sir is tired of waiting...

1280
01:22:59,577 --> 01:23:01,248
...then why are you awake, Balraamji?

1281
01:23:02,317 --> 01:23:03,282
Hariraamji, Sir!

1282
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:05,324
Younger brother?

1283
01:23:08,103 --> 01:23:09,741
Close the door and sleep!

1284
01:23:10,543 --> 01:23:13,431
Pushpa dint do any good
by ignoring Anand Babu!

1285
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:17,533
The one who doesnt care about herself,
what is the use talking about her?

1286
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,519
Here he comes

1287
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:23,599
Monster!

1288
01:23:24,845 --> 01:23:26,267
What are you doing here?

1289
01:23:28,956 --> 01:23:29,771
Nothing

1290
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:30,591
Nothing!

1291
01:23:30,888 --> 01:23:31,662
Grandson of the Nawab!

1292
01:23:32,236 --> 01:23:33,858
He is a waste!

1293
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:35,227
Go

1294
01:23:36,147 --> 01:23:39,024
3 days are left for the
pooja (worship)!

1295
01:23:40,066 --> 01:23:41,417
The idol is still not complete!

1296
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:44,973
You havent still got the soil
from the singers courtyard!

1297
01:23:45,652 --> 01:23:47,035
I dont understand one thing...

1298
01:23:47,712 --> 01:23:50,845
.....why is the holy idol of Durga Ma
made with that filt?

1299
01:23:51,432 --> 01:23:52,351
Who knows

1300
01:23:52,829 --> 01:23:54,332
Its an old tradition!

1301
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:58,717
Without including that soil
the idol is not complete!

1302
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,571
You do your work,
I'll get the soil!

1303
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,880
When will you color the idol uncle?

1304
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:06,656
In 1 or 2 days!

1305
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,050
Where did you get Night jasmine from?

1306
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:10,054
From the garden opposite us!

1307
01:24:10,677 --> 01:24:11,868
Go and plant it at home!

1308
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:12,995
Many flowers will blossom!

1309
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:13,921
Really?
-Yes

1310
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,159
Then what?

1311
01:24:15,521 --> 01:24:16,735
Go and plant it

1312
01:24:17,103 --> 01:24:17,989
Else it will dry up!

1313
01:24:18,501 --> 01:24:19,155
Go

1314
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,273
What will you do with this mud?

1315
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,233
The idol of Durga Ma will be made
with this mud!

1316
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,476
Is it good?

1317
01:24:33,995 --> 01:24:36,433
Good? it is extremly holy!

1318
01:24:37,004 --> 01:24:38,330
Can I plant this here?

1319
01:24:38,428 --> 01:24:39,961
Yes, why not?

1320
01:24:40,028 --> 01:24:40,904
Plant it

1321
01:24:45,016 --> 01:24:46,878
Thank you

1322
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:47,742
Greetings

1323
01:24:55,896 --> 01:24:57,599
What are you doing?

1324
01:24:57,977 --> 01:24:59,376
I am planting.....

1325
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:00,774
.....Night jasmine

1326
01:25:02,452 --> 01:25:04,002
When it will grow...

1327
01:25:04,028 --> 01:25:05,807
...many flowers will blosoom on it

1328
01:25:06,757 --> 01:25:08,074
And what will you do with
those flowers?

1329
01:25:08,627 --> 01:25:10,553
I'll pluck a flower
and will give it to you!

1330
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:12,691
Me?
-Yes

1331
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:14,190
You pray to god, right?

1332
01:25:17,262 --> 01:25:18,203
You know...

1333
01:25:18,737 --> 01:25:22,870
....when this plant will grow,
one bird will....

1334
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,306
.....sit on it and make a nest
on it!

1335
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:26,475
Really?

1336
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:27,853
Then what?

1337
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:33,839
Then on the full moon day, the bird's
mother will keep 3 eggs in it!

1338
01:25:34,406 --> 01:25:39,180
Very nice, on the full moon day the bird's
mother will keep 3 eggs in it!

1339
01:25:39,429 --> 01:25:40,947
Who told you all this?

1340
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:42,390
Lalu!

1341
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:43,403
Who is Lalu?

1342
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,738
My friend!

1343
01:25:45,325 --> 01:25:46,075
He stays in the village!

1344
01:25:47,157 --> 01:25:48,706
Have you ever been to
Madhapur?

1345
01:25:50,203 --> 01:25:51,090
Madhavpur?
-Yes

1346
01:25:52,364 --> 01:25:53,515
Earlier, We used to stay there!

1347
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:59,741
There was a big nest By the lake,
under the tree

1348
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:00,793
Lalu picked it up....

1349
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:02,285
...placed it on the tree

1350
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:07,284
And said on the full moon day the bird's
mother will keep 3 eggs in it!

1351
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:12,560
Are you listening to me?

1352
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:14,685
I am listening

1353
01:26:15,885 --> 01:26:18,754
look, I have planted a sapling here

1354
01:26:19,419 --> 01:26:20,523
Dont let it dry

1355
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,230
No child

1356
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:24,755
I will never let it dry

1357
01:26:26,156 --> 01:26:27,225
Never!

1358
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,398
You?

1359
01:26:46,187 --> 01:26:50,849
Yes I remember you had refused
me to come here!

1360
01:26:52,633 --> 01:26:53,359
Then why did you come?

1361
01:26:55,437 --> 01:26:56,667
Why can I not come?

1362
01:26:56,717 --> 01:26:57,971
To know that

1363
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:03,578
Your wife doesnt want you to come!

1364
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:07,132
World's any wife wouldnt
want...

1365
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:08,689
.....her husband to come here!

1366
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:11,592
Then why do you upset her?

1367
01:27:12,247 --> 01:27:15,333
Happiness, the little happiness
I have got,...

1368
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:17,031
....I have got it here!

1369
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:22,940
My wedding is the biggest question of my life!

1370
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,605
Still she is your wife

1371
01:27:27,565 --> 01:27:30,971
Yes, this is like a trump card for her!

1372
01:27:32,074 --> 01:27:33,808
And so my house is a house of cards

1373
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:36,891
How many ever times I try to make it

1374
01:27:37,446 --> 01:27:38,492
...that many times it breaks!

1375
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:41,178
God knows how would she be....

1376
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,164
...who is not happy with
a man like you!

1377
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:45,871
Forget about her!

1378
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,567
Even you dont want Pushpa...

1379
01:27:50,227 --> 01:27:52,156
.....I should forget my
sorrow for sometime!

1380
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:53,834
Anand Babu...

1381
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:01,244
Did you water my plant?

1382
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,198
Plant?

1383
01:28:02,264 --> 01:28:02,942
Which plant?

1384
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:04,550
Night Jasmine!

1385
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,712
He got it from somewhere and
planted it in our courtyard!

1386
01:28:09,542 --> 01:28:14,597
The answer that I expected from you
I got it from Nandu Babu

1387
01:28:15,759 --> 01:28:18,060
Nandu Babu will blossom flowers
in your courtyard

1388
01:28:18,164 --> 01:28:20,043
Night jasmine

1389
01:28:20,939 --> 01:28:21,961
I am a hurdle!

1390
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:23,610
Dont say that

1391
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:25,742
There is no harm in telling
the truth!

1392
01:28:26,561 --> 01:28:28,542
This plant can dry if I come here

1393
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:30,838
The night jasmine will wither!

1394
01:28:31,789 --> 01:28:32,341
No

1395
01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:34,501
You dont know!

1396
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:37,045
I have a lot of faith in you!

1397
01:28:38,153 --> 01:28:39,304
I like you so much!

1398
01:28:40,986 --> 01:28:42,064
You like me?

1399
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:43,454
Yes

1400
01:28:44,389 --> 01:28:46,531
And so I dont want you to come here!

1401
01:28:47,983 --> 01:28:51,054
If you dont want me to come
I wont come!

1402
01:28:52,508 --> 01:28:54,442
May be after today we wont meet....

1403
01:28:55,168 --> 01:29:00,143
....but still at anytime you need my
help dont hesitate to ask me!

1404
01:29:02,105 --> 01:29:02,679
I am leaving!

1405
01:29:04,137 --> 01:29:04,671
Nandu Babu

1406
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:06,538

1407
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:09,874

Pushpa, I knew you are a...

1504
01:35:18,498 --> 01:35:19,442
...very nice person!

1505
01:35:20,906 --> 01:35:23,360
But you have a big heart,
today I got to know!

1506
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:27,744
I open up everytime
I meet you!

1507
01:35:30,258 --> 01:35:32,184
You should consult a
specialist!

1508
01:35:32,759 --> 01:35:33,204
Specialist?

1509
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:34,068
Yes

1510
01:35:34,189 --> 01:35:36,162
This case is complicating!

1511
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:42,420
Doctor Gosh is the perfect
one to consult!

1512
01:35:43,514 --> 01:35:44,079
Doctor Gosh?
-Yes

1513
01:35:44,694 --> 01:35:46,874
But his fees is very high, right?

1514
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:47,423
Yes!

1515
01:35:47,818 --> 01:35:49,656
He doesnt even lessen a single penny!

1516
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,514
Still he is a well known specialist!

1517
01:35:52,801 --> 01:35:53,511
Mr. Mahesh

1518
01:35:54,103 --> 01:35:54,461
Whose it?

1519
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:55,528
Doctor Gosh

1520
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:59,384
You are Mr. Mahesh
-Yes

1521
01:35:59,816 --> 01:36:00,526
Your son is unwell?

1522
01:36:00,824 --> 01:36:01,837
Yes!
Hes here?

1523
01:36:02,144 --> 01:36:02,560
C'mon!

1524
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,854
Show your tongue!
Nandu remove your tongue!

1525
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,052
Little more

1526
01:36:24,782 --> 01:36:25,651
Thats it

1527
01:36:30,575 --> 01:36:31,574
Okay, give me one paper

1528
01:36:31,624 --> 01:36:32,253
Take this

1529
01:36:34,533 --> 01:36:35,164
What is your child's name?

1530
01:36:35,651 --> 01:36:36,153
Nandu

1531
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:41,500
Get this medicine from my dispensary...

1532
01:36:41,995 --> 01:36:43,106
...dont worry

1533
01:36:43,148 --> 01:36:43,954
Everything will be fine!

1534
01:36:45,463 --> 01:36:46,965
Okay doctor

1535
01:36:48,372 --> 01:36:49,554
Doctor, your fees?

1536
01:36:50,025 --> 01:36:51,511
Dont worry about the fees

1537
01:36:51,945 --> 01:36:53,639
First get the medicines
and cure him!

1538
01:36:54,173 --> 01:36:54,626
okay I am leaving

1539
01:36:55,096 --> 01:36:55,653
I am running late

1540
01:36:56,562 --> 01:36:57,115
Okay

1541
01:36:59,963 --> 01:37:01,603
Anand you are still here?

1542
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:04,201
I thought of asking you!

1543
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:05,772
Anything serious?

1544
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,960
Would have been serious if
you would be late with the treatment!

1545
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:09,412
He has typhoid

1546
01:37:09,911 --> 01:37:10,781
Nothing serious right?

1547
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:12,502
Everything will be fine

1548
01:37:14,104 --> 01:37:17,095
Dont worry about the expenses
for his treatment

1549
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:18,279
Take 200 rupees rest...!

1550
01:37:18,187 --> 01:37:19,297
Why would I take money from you?

1551
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:22,543
I am not giving you this money
but it from the mother!

1552
01:37:22,951 --> 01:37:23,439
Okay

1553
01:37:23,953 --> 01:37:24,567
Tell me one thing...

1554
01:37:25,067 --> 01:37:26,321
How are you related to Nandu?

1555
01:37:28,828 --> 01:37:29,290
Relation?

1556
01:37:31,742 --> 01:37:34,022
If someone doesnt belong to you and
you still relate to him...

1557
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:34,919
what will you say?

1558
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:37,396
Its a lovely relationship!

1559
01:37:38,383 --> 01:37:39,563
You wont understand!

1560
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:40,618
You wont understand

1561
01:37:58,424 --> 01:38:00,863
Nandu Babu you are perfectly alright!

1562
01:38:01,585 --> 01:38:03,334
From when can I start eating normally?

1563
01:38:03,908 --> 01:38:07,177
Wait for two more days you
can eat whatever you want!

1564
01:38:07,829 --> 01:38:08,374
Okay

1565
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:09,278
Okay I am leaving okay

1566
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:11,656
Mahesh Babu
-Yes!

1567
01:38:12,868 --> 01:38:13,946
Dont change the medicine!

1568
01:38:14,677 --> 01:38:16,419
Continue those medicines for
two more days!

1569
01:38:18,366 --> 01:38:21,491
Doctor, I'll ask you something
I hope you dont feel bad!

1570
01:38:22,232 --> 01:38:23,015
Tell me

1571
01:38:23,082 --> 01:38:26,877
You have been visiting us
since so long, you havent taken your fees....

1572
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,589
...neither did you charge for
the medicines...

1573
01:38:29,323 --> 01:38:30,785
I cant understand a single thing!

1574
01:38:31,297 --> 01:38:32,432
But I can understand everything!

1575
01:38:33,062 --> 01:38:33,819
What?

1576
01:38:33,894 --> 01:38:35,153
You are Bholanath!

1577
01:38:35,556 --> 01:38:36,017
Meaning?

1578
01:38:36,074 --> 01:38:40,294
His mother has already paid me for the
medicines and my fees in advance

1579
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:41,477
Dont you kow?

1580
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:42,747
Strange

1581
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:44,991
Gentlemen, besides office...

1582
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:47,310
...arent you updated about
your house?

1583
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:55,730
Kamla, I dont understand anything!

1584
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:57,500
Who paid him?

1585
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,395
God knows, even I dont understand!

1586
01:39:01,545 --> 01:39:02,351
Surprising

1587
01:39:03,086 --> 01:39:04,375
Today after returning from office....

1588
01:39:04,974 --> 01:39:06,043
.....I'll find out!

1589
01:39:06,956 --> 01:39:07,370
Listen...

1590
01:39:07,522 --> 01:39:09,841
....now we should fix a date!

1591
01:39:10,692 --> 01:39:11,450
I have taken a leave application

1592
01:39:12,275 --> 01:39:12,857
It will be approved quickly!

1593
01:39:14,034 --> 01:39:15,609
I am going to the village after so long...

1594
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:17,679
...I dont have a saree!

1595
01:39:18,582 --> 01:39:19,820
Please buy one sari!

1596
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:22,727
I'll get my pay today,
I'll get from the market!

1597
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:47,133
My Nandu is alright now?

1598
01:39:47,662 --> 01:39:48,501
He is completely fine!

1599
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:52,458
Give him Sago to eat
he'll be fine till tomorrow!

1600
01:39:54,099 --> 01:39:56,880
Any of your fees is left pending?

1601
01:39:56,962 --> 01:39:57,839
No

1602
01:39:57,865 --> 01:40:01,102
Tell me one thing, the
fees that you have paid me...

1603
01:40:01,266 --> 01:40:02,879
.....why is it that Mahesh Babu is
unaware of it?

1604
01:40:03,823 --> 01:40:06,548
The thing is...

1605
01:40:07,678 --> 01:40:09,013
....I am not his real mother!

1606
01:40:12,186 --> 01:40:12,833
Greetings

1607
01:40:25,176 --> 01:40:26,341
Pushpa

1608
01:40:31,211 --> 01:40:31,761
Pushpa, listen to me

1609
01:40:34,324 --> 01:40:34,937
Pushpa

1610
01:40:38,892 --> 01:40:40,873
I did a big mistake in
recognizing you!

1611
01:40:42,741 --> 01:40:46,299
You havent just paid for the medicines and
his fees....

1612
01:40:47,922 --> 01:40:49,537
...but you have a new life to Nandu

1613
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:52,871
I did not have money for his treatment!

1614
01:40:54,881 --> 01:40:56,478
I can never pay you....

1615
01:40:57,512 --> 01:40:58,742
...back your favour done to me!

1616
01:41:00,594 --> 01:41:01,792
I misunderstood you!

1617
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,049
Please forgive me for that!

1618
01:41:06,092 --> 01:41:06,867
Brother

1619
01:41:06,961 --> 01:41:08,062
Yes sister

1620
01:41:09,743 --> 01:41:11,468
Besides Faith and devotion...

1621
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:13,141
....I cannot give you anything!

1622
01:41:15,404 --> 01:41:16,562
This is a sari

1623
01:41:17,425 --> 01:41:19,135

1624

.....it on the Bhai dooj
(festival of brother-sister relation in India)

1625
01:41:42,699 --> 01:41:44,857
Aunty!
My son is back?

1626
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:47,685
You are completely fine now?

1627
01:41:48,016 --> 01:41:48,438
Isnt it?

1628
01:41:48,463 --> 01:41:48,960
Yes

1629
01:41:49,016 --> 01:41:51,365
I have bought biscuits for you!

1630
01:41:52,129 --> 01:41:54,807
But before that I'll get an amulet
for you!

1631
01:41:55,817 --> 01:41:56,447
Wait

1632
01:42:08,423 --> 01:42:09,325
Whose is it?

1633
01:42:10,122 --> 01:42:12,721
Godess! I had wished....

1634
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,489
....that you get well soon!

1635
01:42:15,525 --> 01:42:16,908
Keep it tied!

1636
01:42:17,708 --> 01:42:18,906
You'll never fall ill!

1637
01:42:19,905 --> 01:42:20,959
Is it made out of gold?

1638
01:42:23,013 --> 01:42:24,059
You are my gold

1639
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:25,884
My darling son

1640
01:42:27,438 --> 01:42:29,188
Wait, I'll get biscuit for you

1641
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:42,020
Nandu

1642
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:44,147
Where did he go?

1643
01:42:46,215 --> 01:42:48,373
Nandu, Where did you go?

1644
01:42:49,887 --> 01:42:50,598
Nandu

1645
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:51,984
Nandu

1646
01:42:55,918 --> 01:43:02,188

"He's very naughty!"

1651
01:43:47,776 --> 01:43:53,966
"My eyes search for him in all four directions"

1652
01:43:55,123 --> 01:44:01,544
"who knows where Krishna has hidden himself?"

1653
01:44:06,192 --> 01:44:12,309
"My eyes search for him in all four directions"

1654

"Mother"

1668
01:45:57,856 --> 01:46:04,325
"Krishna is a very mischievous rogue"

1669
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:08,694
"what will Yashoda-Ma do with him?"

1670
01:46:12,482 --> 01:46:15,351
"He's very mischievous!"

1671
01:46:17,747 --> 01:46:20,530
You know we are leaving from
here day after tomorrow?

1672
01:46:21,397 --> 01:46:22,276
You are going?

1673
01:46:24,146 --> 01:46:25,241
Where?
-Village

1674
01:46:26,676 --> 01:46:27,882
You'll leave me and go!

1675
01:46:28,475 --> 01:46:31,521
Everyone is going even I'll have to go!

1676
01:46:33,569 --> 01:46:34,887
You'll never meet me again?

1677
01:46:35,803 --> 01:46:36,305
Why not?

1678
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:37,937
I'll come to meet you!

1679
01:46:39,676 --> 01:46:41,217
I'll definitely come back

1680
01:46:41,906 --> 01:46:42,560
Now I'll go?

1681
01:46:44,536 --> 01:46:45,118
Go

1682
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:56,706
Dont remove it!

1683
01:46:57,334 --> 01:47:00,484
That cheap woman has tied it
for you!

1684
01:47:00,861 --> 01:47:02,027
Worthless, Shameless!

1685
01:47:02,415 --> 01:47:03,268
Bindiya!

1686
01:47:03,629 --> 01:47:06,388
Take this and give it to Pushpa
and tell that witch...

1687
01:47:06,877 --> 01:47:08,090
....her sins are not less!

1688
01:47:08,493 --> 01:47:10,827
And now she would tie such amulets
and wants to Witchcraft on children?

1689
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:11,826
Throw it on her face!

1690
01:47:12,903 --> 01:47:15,844
Nandu, only 2 days left
to return back to the village!

1691
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:19,994
I'll break your bones if you
again go there!

1692
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:21,044
Understood?

1693
01:47:29,069 --> 01:47:30,243
Pushpa

1694
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:35,264
Take this amulet!

1695
01:47:51,815 --> 01:47:53,671
Kamla, all packed?

1696
01:47:54,012 --> 01:47:54,683
Yes

1697
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:55,873
Even I have packed everything...

1698
01:47:56,283 --> 01:47:56,880
...I'll get the car

1699
01:48:16,887 --> 01:48:18,557
Nandu Babu

1700
01:48:19,061 --> 01:48:19,539
Come in

1701
01:48:25,909 --> 01:48:27,052
You got hurt

1702
01:48:27,227 --> 01:48:27,946
No problem

1703
01:48:28,682 --> 01:48:30,600
I'll apply some cement on it
It will be fine!

1704
01:48:30,919 --> 01:48:32,573
No No I'll get medicine!
Nandu

1705
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,169
Nandu let it be

1706
01:48:39,231 --> 01:48:41,444
Mother, brother has come!

1707
01:48:41,955 --> 01:48:44,177
What are you doing?

1708
01:48:44,931 --> 01:48:46,209
Where did you go?

1709
01:48:46,928 --> 01:48:48,741
What is in your hand? Show me!

1710
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:52,091
Medicine? Who needs it?

1711
01:48:52,143 --> 01:48:52,881
Hers

1712
01:48:53,349 --> 01:48:54,658
Pushpa

1713
01:48:55,177 --> 01:48:57,112
Now you are stealing medicines
and taking for her

1714
01:48:57,591 --> 01:48:59,269
Yes I'll go!
Give it to me!

1715
01:48:59,335 --> 01:49:00,937
I wont give, leave me!

1716
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,983
You are back answering me!

1717
01:49:06,532 --> 01:49:07,450
How dare you?

1718
01:49:07,985 --> 01:49:09,719
Come back, I will kill you!

1719
01:49:18,831 --> 01:49:20,084
What are you doing?

1720
01:49:21,357 --> 01:49:22,939
You got medicines for me!

1721
01:49:23,481 --> 01:49:24,358
You bandaged me!

1722
01:49:24,848 --> 01:49:25,422
So what happen?

1723
01:49:25,999 --> 01:49:26,524
What happen?

1724
01:49:27,724 --> 01:49:28,434
That you wont understand!

1725
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:31,634
I'll never forget this day

1726
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,830
You all are going today?

1727
01:49:36,306 --> 01:49:36,705
Yes

1728
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:38,042
In sometime

1729
01:49:38,092 --> 01:49:39,570
Father has gone to get the car

1730
01:49:41,167 --> 01:49:42,357
You'll never meet me?

1731
01:49:43,063 --> 01:49:44,701
Why not?
When I'll grow up...

1732
01:49:45,185 --> 01:49:46,326
...I'll come to meet you!

1733
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:48,172
And I'll take my amulet again!

1734
01:49:49,078 --> 01:49:49,987
Keep it safely!

1735
01:49:50,683 --> 01:49:51,272
Yes

1736
01:49:51,897 --> 01:49:52,518
I'll definitely treasure it

1737
01:49:53,544 --> 01:49:55,078
Okay I am leaving

1738
01:49:55,623 --> 01:49:56,725
Otherwise my new mother will hit
me a lot!

1739
01:49:59,491 --> 01:49:59,860
Go!

1740
01:50:06,107 --> 01:50:07,417
What is this?

1741
01:50:07,961 --> 01:50:10,342
You are touching my feet
inspite being a son of a Brahman!

1742
01:50:11,074 --> 01:50:14,840
You love me so much and so
I'll worship you

1743
01:50:18,555 --> 01:50:19,297
Go

1744
01:50:20,011 --> 01:50:21,448
God bless you always!

1745
01:50:23,627 --> 01:50:24,180
Go

1746
01:50:48,590 --> 01:50:49,996
Mother, brother has come!

1747
01:50:52,931 --> 01:50:53,889
You are back?

1748
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,870
Worthless, Shameless!

1749
01:50:58,988 --> 01:50:59,579
You went there

1750
01:50:59,914 --> 01:51:01,215
You bited me and went to
aid her?

1751
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,955
Went to aid her!

1752
01:51:03,989 --> 01:51:05,611
She is your mother and I mean
nothing to you

1753
01:51:06,016 --> 01:51:07,966
I'll kill you

1754
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:10,538
Give me an answer

1755
01:51:11,391 --> 01:51:12,588
My wish, I'll go!

1756
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:14,271
Again you'll go?

1757
01:51:14,664 --> 01:51:16,806
Hit me how much ever you want
I'll go!

1758
01:51:17,076 --> 01:51:18,129
You are back answering me?

1759
01:51:22,067 --> 01:51:25,159
You are back answering me?

1760
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,368
I wont spare you today

1761
01:51:28,201 --> 01:51:30,520
Will you go again?
Yes I'll go

1762
01:51:30,953 --> 01:51:32,831
You are back answering me?

1763
01:51:33,246 --> 01:51:34,837
Dont hit him, he is not at fault!

1764
01:51:35,958 --> 01:51:37,508
Hit me how much ever you want
I'll go!

1765
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:40,005
He'll never come to meet me!

1766
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:42,879
I join my hands, please stop it

1767
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:43,830
Dont hit him!

1768
01:51:44,434 --> 01:51:46,679
You want to go there,
go die!

1769
01:51:51,601 --> 01:51:52,447
Why did you come?

1770
01:51:52,887 --> 01:51:54,886
Say? Why did you come?

1771
01:51:55,311 --> 01:51:56,692
You were hurt on your leg

1772
01:51:57,183 --> 01:51:58,605
Why would you bother if my leg got hurt?

1773
01:51:59,267 --> 01:52:00,088
Could have left me to die

1774
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,206
Say, you'll never come again
to meet me!

1775
01:52:03,778 --> 01:52:04,351
Say

1776
01:52:05,002 --> 01:52:07,016
Even you refuse me to come!

1777
01:52:08,129 --> 01:52:10,038
Even you refuse me to come!

1778
01:52:11,561 --> 01:52:12,408
I wont come!

1779
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,582
I wont come!

1780
01:52:16,382 --> 01:52:17,093
No son

1781
01:52:17,656 --> 01:52:18,878
How can I stop you?

1782
01:52:21,002 --> 01:52:22,185
But what do I do?

1783
01:52:27,522 --> 01:52:29,496
Pushpa, go away from here

1784
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:31,428
We are going to leave in sometime!

1785
01:52:32,059 --> 01:52:34,849
Before leaving we dont want
to see your face!

1786
01:52:48,506 --> 01:52:52,904
"O Mother"

1787
01:53:11,968 --> 01:53:15,909
Pushpa, you know your son is
leaving?

1788
01:53:18,406 --> 01:53:19,165
I know!

1789
01:53:39,245 --> 01:53:42,555
"O Mother"

1790
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:52,802
There are many cars in Calcutta?
-Yes

1791
01:53:53,649 --> 01:53:54,191
Many

1792
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:55,389
Cars of 2 floors!

1793
01:53:56,269 --> 01:53:57,101
Very big ones!

1794
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:59,658
Really?
And a big variety of food!

1795
01:54:00,144 --> 01:54:01,079
What should I tell you?

1796
01:54:01,395 --> 01:54:06,221
Samose, Imarti, Kachori!
How do they taste?

1797
01:54:07,141 --> 01:54:07,882
Very nice

1798
01:54:08,713 --> 01:54:10,663
Everyday your father brought all
this for you?

1799
01:54:11,409 --> 01:54:12,001
No

1800
01:54:12,758 --> 01:54:13,949
Your new mother would make you have?

1801
01:54:14,592 --> 01:54:15,193
No

1802
01:54:16,088 --> 01:54:17,024
She would make me have

1803
01:54:17,069 --> 01:54:17,962
Who?

1804
01:54:18,309 --> 01:54:19,586
She was very nice

1805
01:54:20,498 --> 01:54:22,248
She loved me a lot

1806
01:54:46,257 --> 01:54:48,167
Nandu Babu

1807
01:54:49,752 --> 01:54:50,894
Dint you recognize me?

1808
01:54:51,442 --> 01:54:55,087
Why will you recognize your
villager friend?

1809
01:54:55,501 --> 01:54:57,242
Matric failed, Chandar!

1810
01:54:58,090 --> 01:54:58,641
Chandar?

1811
01:54:59,179 --> 01:55:00,321
Sorry I took time to recognize you

1812
01:55:00,913 --> 01:55:02,255
You have completely changed!

1813
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:07,688
In 250 rupees a man stays alive
and should even be well dressed...

1814
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:09,665
...thats not possible!

1815
01:55:10,407 --> 01:55:10,957
What do you do?

1816
01:55:11,568 --> 01:55:13,974
I am a sales agent of
420 companies!

1817
01:55:14,678 --> 01:55:17,468
I sell simulated oil and brushing powder!

1818
01:55:17,951 --> 01:55:19,694
Anyway tell me about you!

1819
01:55:20,165 --> 01:55:21,723
Heard you are an engineer

1820
01:55:22,287 --> 01:55:25,430
Yes I was in Patna for 5 years
and now I am transfered here before a week!

1821
01:55:25,954 --> 01:55:26,929
And your parents?

1822
01:55:27,517 --> 01:55:29,290
They are still there and I am finding a flat

1823
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,171
Okay

1824
01:55:31,362 --> 01:55:33,223
How are you here early this morning?

1825
01:55:33,997 --> 01:55:36,900
I was passing by from here,
I saw this place and stopped here!

1826
01:55:37,561 --> 01:55:38,440
Anything special?

1827
01:55:39,418 --> 01:55:39,906
Yes

1828
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:44,207
Look, the dirt of the entire city...

1829
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:49,210
.....from this gutter flow in the
River Ganga

1830
01:55:51,022 --> 01:55:52,644
And then this dirt purifies!

1831
01:55:53,536 --> 01:55:54,670
Its called Gangajal!

1832
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:58,095
I remembered someone seeing this place!

1833
01:55:58,138 --> 01:55:58,665
Whose?

1834
01:55:59,633 --> 01:56:00,408
Someone

1835
01:56:02,302 --> 01:56:04,486
Her life was like a dirty drain...

1836
01:56:05,453 --> 01:56:08,282
...but her soul was pure
like Gangajal!

1837
01:56:08,806 --> 01:56:09,674
But who was she?

1838
01:56:10,756 --> 01:56:11,449
Not ours

1839
01:56:12,175 --> 01:56:13,205
But the affection she gave me....

1840
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,190
I think no one would have got
it even from a real mother

1841
01:56:18,254 --> 01:56:19,901
I am glad to meet you

1842
01:56:20,291 --> 01:56:21,218
Okay I am leaving

1843
01:56:21,618 --> 01:56:22,184
I am running late!

1844
01:56:22,561 --> 01:56:23,838
I have to sell oil!

1845
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:26,734
I hope we again meet someday!

1846
01:56:28,297 --> 01:56:29,663
Find a flat

1847
01:56:29,722 --> 01:56:32,028
I'll come to your place for tea

1848
01:56:32,177 --> 01:56:33,190
Definitely

1849
01:56:33,832 --> 01:56:34,599
Okay

1850
01:56:45,812 --> 01:56:47,778
Idiot why are you repeating
so many times!

1851
01:56:48,151 --> 01:56:49,285
Mother Ganga is deaf?

1852
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:52,978
I am praying her since 14 years

1853
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:54,851
What has mother Ganga given?

1854
01:56:55,309 --> 01:56:58,275
A business of oil between a mob!

1855
01:56:58,772 --> 01:56:59,995
And have to scream high!

1856
01:57:03,158 --> 01:57:05,366
Poor guy, being a Brahman's son,
he has to sell oil!

1857
01:57:05,889 --> 01:57:06,751
Everything depends on luck!

1858
01:57:07,795 --> 01:57:09,313
I'll have to see his Horoscope someday!

1859
01:57:09,837 --> 01:57:11,139
Brother, read my hand

1860
01:57:11,173 --> 01:57:12,786
Today after a great difficulty you've
hold it

1861
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:15,763
I have washed my hands with a soap!

1862
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:19,098
What is this? You used my soap?
Give it to me!

1863
01:57:19,505 --> 01:57:20,104
Move aside!

1864
01:57:20,529 --> 01:57:21,976
You think fortune telling is magic?

1865
01:57:22,236 --> 01:57:23,955
Like you can perform anywhere you want!

1866
01:57:36,283 --> 01:57:38,296
Old woman, have you put cotton
in  your ears?

1867
01:57:39,073 --> 01:57:40,678
The one in room no 7 is shouting for water!

1868
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:42,053
Go and give him water

1869
01:57:43,358 --> 01:57:43,988
I am going!

1870
01:57:44,631 --> 01:57:47,973
And these vessels? You havent
still washed them!

1871
01:57:48,317 --> 01:57:50,074
These people have to leave for office!

1872
01:57:50,101 --> 01:57:51,097
When will I cook?

1873
01:57:52,246 --> 01:57:54,445
I dont understand how did my horse loose?

1874
01:57:54,705 --> 01:57:56,639
Before that I had won twice!

1875
01:57:57,127 --> 01:57:57,611
Leave Shamu,

1876
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,090
Our grandparents havent left anything
for us....

1877
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:01,497
....what will their grandparents leave?

1878
01:58:01,556 --> 01:58:04,211
Who'll win this time?

1879
01:58:04,302 --> 01:58:05,716
Shut up!

1880
01:58:07,994 --> 01:58:09,353
What? Has anyone died?

1881
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,775
I am sorry,I pushed by mistake!

1882
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:12,975
Put water

1883
01:58:13,687 --> 01:58:14,332
Give me water!

1884
01:58:16,494 --> 01:58:16,972
Take it!

1885
01:58:21,986 --> 01:58:24,234
Ramu

1886
01:58:24,674 --> 01:58:26,616
How will I get a kid?

1887
01:58:26,675 --> 01:58:31,425
I think I'll die being a bachelor serving you all
day in day out!

1888
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:32,239
Pundari Babu!

1889
01:58:32,649 --> 01:58:33,903
Its Pundarikaksh!

1890
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:36,322
I am sorry Pundarikaksh Babu

1891
01:58:36,373 --> 01:58:37,538
Where were you since so long?

1892
01:58:37,889 --> 01:58:38,702
Ask me where I wasnt present?

1893
01:58:39,196 --> 01:58:40,514
I went to buy Rasgulla (Sweet)
for Ghanshaam Babu!

1894
01:58:41,055 --> 01:58:43,086
I got tabacco for our chef Jalia!

1895
01:58:43,445 --> 01:58:45,076
And for Sitaraam,....

1896
01:58:45,196 --> 01:58:46,530
.....I went to polish his shoes!

1897
01:58:46,733 --> 01:58:48,305
And for Lal Babu...!
Shut up!

1898
01:58:48,755 --> 01:58:50,225
What did I ask you to do?

1899
01:58:50,841 --> 01:58:52,150
Every morning you'll fill water!

1900
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,182
If I dont get water after I wake up...

1901
01:58:54,775 --> 01:58:55,797
....I stomach becomes upset!

1902
01:58:56,425 --> 01:58:57,510
Go and get water

1903
01:58:57,552 --> 01:58:58,016
I'll just get

1904
01:58:58,312 --> 01:58:58,902
Go!
I'll just get!

1905
01:59:02,878 --> 01:59:04,148
Give water to him

1906
01:59:04,166 --> 01:59:06,363
But this is for the one in room no.7

1907
01:59:06,716 --> 01:59:09,217
First he'll have!

1908
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:10,554
Else his stomach becomes upset

1909
01:59:10,627 --> 01:59:11,248
Understood?

1910
01:59:12,828 --> 01:59:16,291
Greetings! Astrologer, read
my hand and say...

1911
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:19,048
....when will I get married?

1912
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:21,057
You'll get married when you'll pass away!

1913
01:59:21,369 --> 01:59:21,944
Punk!

1914
01:59:22,102 --> 01:59:23,388
You make fun of my knowledge!

1915
01:59:24,002 --> 01:59:25,920
Its 9 already wont we get late?

1916
01:59:26,052 --> 01:59:27,194
Even if we get late...!

1917
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:44,675
You?

1918
01:59:46,051 --> 01:59:46,889
Here?

1919
01:59:48,609 --> 01:59:50,687
I want to ask you this question....

1920
01:59:53,528 --> 01:59:54,391
....you and here?

1921
01:59:55,452 --> 01:59:56,689
I work here!

1922
02:00:01,177 --> 02:00:02,202
Are you fine?

1923
02:00:03,114 --> 02:00:03,793
Wrong

1924
02:00:04,304 --> 02:00:06,504
You should have asked, are you happy?

1925
02:00:10,559 --> 02:00:12,478
Anand, this maid used to work
at your place?

1926
02:00:18,696 --> 02:00:20,776
Pushpa, what is this?

1927
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:26,027
You saw me after ages and you started
crying?

1928
02:00:27,614 --> 02:00:31,315
You forgot? I hate tears,
wipe those tears!

1929
02:00:33,275 --> 02:00:35,722
I have seen many ups and downs
in life!

1930
02:00:36,878 --> 02:00:40,411
Thinking that I wont be surprised
with anything!

1931
02:00:41,959 --> 02:00:43,900
But today after seeing you I
did get surprised!

1932
02:00:45,091 --> 02:00:47,145
This place is better than that place!

1933
02:00:48,296 --> 02:00:49,310
Where I lived earlier!

1934
02:00:51,145 --> 02:00:51,846
Pushpa!

1935
02:00:53,517 --> 02:00:56,443
You wont change whereever you'll
live!

1936
02:00:57,505 --> 02:01:00,351
Earlier you cleaned people's
hearts...

1937
02:01:01,451 --> 02:01:04,033
....today you clean their utensils!

1938
02:01:05,562 --> 02:01:11,504
You purify every particle of dirt just
by touching it!

1939
02:01:13,018 --> 02:01:14,079
Do you know...

1940
02:01:17,872 --> 02:01:19,734
....you have met me after so
long...

1941
02:01:20,998 --> 02:01:24,229
....but I feel I have never stayed
away from you!

1942
02:01:26,721 --> 02:01:29,647
C'mon Anand, Chatterji Babu
is waiting for us

1943
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:32,737
Where are you lost?

1944
02:01:33,827 --> 02:01:34,570
What is the matter?

1945
02:01:35,401 --> 02:01:38,854
Some old realtion with this
maid Pushpa?

1946
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:42,839
You are a broker..

1947
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:44,166
You wont understand!

1948
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:50,125
Sometimes in life.....

1949
02:01:50,957 --> 02:01:52,435
....one has to risk.....

1950
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,910
......and have to deal with loss!

1951
02:01:57,265 --> 02:01:57,655
What?

1952
02:01:58,738 --> 02:01:59,463
You wont understand!

1953
02:02:01,013 --> 02:02:02,083
C'mon

1954
02:02:05,115 --> 02:02:08,176
Ramratan Babu, I am leaving
I have to catch an 8:10 train!

1955
02:02:13,821 --> 02:02:14,939
Take care of him

1956
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:15,819
He is ill

1957
02:02:21,306 --> 02:02:22,387
Take this

1958
02:02:26,216 --> 02:02:27,166
Who are you?

1959
02:02:29,714 --> 02:02:32,871
I am a new maid here!

1960
02:02:34,255 --> 02:02:35,789
Where is Ramu?

1961
02:02:37,603 --> 02:02:38,201
I dont know

1962
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:44,407
I am blind and I am thirsty...

1963
02:02:47,574 --> 02:02:51,580
...I cant get water on my own!

1964
02:02:52,735 --> 02:02:54,926
Give me!

1965
02:03:06,454 --> 02:03:09,204
Sister in law, brother got married
for the second time!

1966
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:10,580
What?
Yes sister in law!

1967
02:03:15,808 --> 02:03:16,838
He has got the new bride
home!

1968
02:03:26,467 --> 02:03:29,642
Pushpa, take her like younger sister!

1969
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:34,292
And she shouldnt face any problems!

1970
02:03:35,186 --> 02:03:37,217
But without telling me?

1971
02:03:37,304 --> 02:03:38,142
I dint feel the need

1972
02:03:39,165 --> 02:03:39,907
Come

1973
02:03:50,453 --> 02:03:51,083
Take this!

1974
02:03:52,183 --> 02:03:52,821
You left?

1975
02:03:54,568 --> 02:03:58,278
If you meet Ramu, send him here

1976
02:03:59,346 --> 02:04:01,007
My head is paining!

1977
02:04:02,217 --> 02:04:04,087
Okay I am sending him!

1978
02:04:28,658 --> 02:04:29,433
Are you finding something?

1979
02:04:30,281 --> 02:04:31,047
Yes

1980
02:04:31,817 --> 02:04:36,544
Some years back Durga, Jharna and few more
girls used to stay there

1981
02:04:37,407 --> 02:04:38,468
They left long back!

1982
02:04:39,177 --> 02:04:41,047
Someone said Jharna passed away

1983
02:04:45,688 --> 02:04:46,782
And in that house...

1984
02:04:47,552 --> 02:04:48,726
...a girl named Pushpa stayed!

1985
02:04:49,591 --> 02:04:50,485
I have no idea about her!

1986
02:04:50,994 --> 02:04:52,040
They left long ago!

1987
02:04:55,753 --> 02:04:57,453
This house is empty?

1988
02:04:58,134 --> 02:04:59,171
Yes, see it

1989
02:04:59,589 --> 02:05:01,122
Talk to the watchman!

1990
02:05:02,165 --> 02:05:02,747
Thank you

1991
02:05:08,958 --> 02:05:15,054
"I would embrace you"

1992
02:05:16,113 --> 02:05:22,489
".....no one casts an evil eye on you
and I hide you in my heart"

1993
02:05:27,118 --> 02:05:33,443
"I would embrace you"

1994
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:40,865
".....no one casts an evil eye on you
and I hide you in my heart"

1995
02:05:41,961 --> 02:05:48,096
"Sun is the world, Affection is shade"

1996
02:05:49,362 --> 02:05:53,145
"what will Yashoda-Ma do with him?"

1997
02:05:56,861 --> 02:05:59,755
"You are very mischievous"

1998
02:06:12,346 --> 02:06:18,783
"You are the only dream of my life"

1999
02:06:19,756 --> 02:06:26,046
"Whoever beholds you considers you beloved."

2000
02:06:27,007 --> 02:06:29,822
"You are evryone's beloved"

2001
02:06:30,789 --> 02:06:33,675
"player of the flute [i.e., Krishna]."

2002
02:06:34,641 --> 02:06:38,009
"what will Yashoda-Ma do with him?"

2003
02:06:41,751 --> 02:06:43,175
"You are very mischievous"

2004
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,488
Get this medicine!

2005
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:45,379
Okay

2006
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:48,316
Later, if needed I'll
give him an injection!

2007
02:06:55,516 --> 02:06:56,394
Doctor, your fees?

2008
02:06:57,088 --> 02:06:57,919
4 rupees

2009
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,771
4 rupees?

2010
02:06:59,533 --> 02:07:00,969
I only have 2 rupees

2011
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:03,626
And I even have to renew
the ticket!

2012
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:04,698
I'll pay?

2013
02:07:05,258 --> 02:07:06,056
You'll pay?

2014
02:07:06,082 --> 02:07:07,089

2015
02:07:07,977 --> 02:07:08,511

...just inform his reletives!

2017
02:07:10,744 --> 02:07:11,518
Reletives?

2018
02:07:12,062 --> 02:07:13,004
He has no one!

2019
02:07:13,453 --> 02:07:14,571
And so I have got him here

2020
02:07:18,843 --> 02:07:19,664
He had 2 wives!

2021
02:07:20,232 --> 02:07:21,685
He chucked out the first one!

2022
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:23,239
And the second one committed
suicide!

2023
02:07:25,049 --> 02:07:25,545
Take this!

2024
02:07:26,959 --> 02:07:27,390
Take this!

2025
02:07:30,251 --> 02:07:31,434
God bless you

2026
02:07:32,124 --> 02:07:33,515
You keep these 2 rupees

2027
02:07:34,179 --> 02:07:34,785
No

2028
02:07:35,377 --> 02:07:36,592
You even have to get his medicines!

2029
02:07:37,219 --> 02:07:39,712
Okay, there is milk kept near
the stove...

2030
02:07:40,228 --> 02:07:41,274
....heat it and give it to him!

2031
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:44,059
I'll get the medicines and I am
even getting late for office!

2032
02:08:24,782 --> 02:08:25,596
No I wont go

02:08:25,985 --> 02:08:26,712
Go out from here!

2034

2035
02:08:28,999 --> 02:08:30,087
I wont leave the house and go

2036
02:08:30,692 --> 02:08:31,451
Why wont you?

2037
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:35,455
Either I'll stay in this house
or me!

2038
02:08:35,537 --> 02:08:36,680
Its even my house

2039
02:08:36,762 --> 02:08:40,549
Its your house? Bitch!
What are you looking at me

2040
02:08:40,906 --> 02:08:41,945
Throw her out

2041
02:08:42,764 --> 02:08:44,211
Are you going or no?

2042
02:08:44,671 --> 02:08:46,782
No, kill me if you want...

2043
02:08:47,285 --> 02:08:48,963
....but I wont leave you and
go!

2044
02:08:49,951 --> 02:08:50,581
You wont go?

2045
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:52,592
Why wont you go?

2046
02:09:05,038 --> 02:09:06,283
Take your clothes and go away

2047
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:03,129
Take this

2048
02:10:05,395 --> 02:10:06,481
Samose?
Yes!

2049
02:10:06,690 --> 02:10:07,816
Brother in law had got it

2050
02:10:08,354 --> 02:10:09,248
You really like it, right?

2051
02:10:10,439 --> 02:10:10,973
Very much

2052
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:15,587
Madam, he is crying a lot today!

2053
02:10:19,557 --> 02:10:21,123
His body is hot!

2054
02:10:21,566 --> 02:10:22,356
He has fever

2055
02:10:23,143 --> 02:10:25,501
Yes, dont worry

2056
02:10:25,837 --> 02:10:26,572
I'll just get doctor!

2057
02:10:34,151 --> 02:10:35,068
Dont worry!

2058
02:10:35,825 --> 02:10:36,734
Just little fever!

2059
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:40,195
Give him medicines everything will be fine!

2060
02:10:40,993 --> 02:10:42,518
You check and that person doesnt get cured?

2061
02:10:43,098 --> 02:10:47,328
You must be not remembering but once
you had treated his father!

2062
02:10:49,919 --> 02:10:52,541
When I was 8 years old!

2063
02:10:53,603 --> 02:10:54,241
What is your name?

2064
02:10:54,831 --> 02:10:55,727
Nand Kishor Sharma!

2065
02:10:56,263 --> 02:10:56,787
Nandu

2066
02:10:57,388 --> 02:10:58,017
Remembered?

2067
02:10:59,076 --> 02:10:59,698
Nandu

2068
02:11:00,473 --> 02:11:01,647
Yes

2069
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:02,352
Now I recollected

2070
02:11:03,067 --> 02:11:05,123
After so long?

2071
02:11:05,946 --> 02:11:06,968
I used to work in Patna!

2072
02:11:07,517 --> 02:11:08,932
I just got transferred to Calcutta!

2073
02:11:09,546 --> 02:11:09,992
Okay

2074
02:11:10,411 --> 02:11:11,137
What do you do hear?

2075
02:11:11,721 --> 02:11:12,687
I am an engineer!

2076
02:11:12,945 --> 02:11:13,552
Engineer!

2077
02:11:13,915 --> 02:11:14,545
Good

2078
02:11:15,347 --> 02:11:17,112
Take this and get these medicines!

2079
02:11:17,756 --> 02:11:19,314
Dont worry

2080
02:11:20,785 --> 02:11:22,439
Still if you need my help,
do call me!

2081
02:11:23,312 --> 02:11:23,789
Yes

2082
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:25,000
Okay Child!

2083
02:11:27,668 --> 02:11:29,834
Chef!

2084
02:11:30,188 --> 02:11:32,698
That man in room no. 7 passed away!

2085
02:11:33,084 --> 02:11:33,698
Ramratanji?
Yes

2086
02:11:34,046 --> 02:11:34,940
Disaster

2087
02:11:41,555 --> 02:11:43,152
Doctor!
-Yes

2088
02:11:43,834 --> 02:11:45,231
If you could write a death certificate?

2089
02:11:46,609 --> 02:11:47,679
You come with me I'll give you!

2090
02:11:53,005 --> 02:11:58,909
"My heart was broken is broken now"

2091
02:12:00,009 --> 02:12:02,736
"My heart was broken is broken now"

2092
02:12:03,232 --> 02:12:05,861
"My bangles splintered just like...."

2093
02:12:06,869 --> 02:12:10,635
".....all these dreams into pieces"

2094
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:19,407
"such was the betrayal a gust of wind came"

2095
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:25,028
"and erased the vermilion from the
parting of my hair"

2096
02:12:26,736 --> 02:12:31,638
"I was robbed lord ram robbed...."

2097
02:12:33,557 --> 02:12:38,364
".....of the sixteen ornaments of traditional beauty"

2098
02:12:40,472 --> 02:12:46,351
"Having settled me in the wedding
palanquin the bearer...."

2099
02:12:47,121 --> 02:12:51,751
".....carried me on behalf of my beloved"

2100
02:12:53,741 --> 02:12:58,714
"Having settled me in the wedding palanquin"

2101
02:13:15,307 --> 02:13:16,305
Anand

2102
02:13:16,317 --> 02:13:17,024
Come in

2103
02:13:17,375 --> 02:13:18,029
Where were you since so
many days?

2104
02:13:18,992 --> 02:13:19,589
Sit

2105
02:13:20,071 --> 02:13:20,797
Are you fine?

2106
02:13:21,711 --> 02:13:24,445
Without falling ill cant I see you?

2107
02:13:25,997 --> 02:13:29,131
I felt like meeting all
old friends!

2108
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:30,354
So I dropped in!

2109
02:13:30,834 --> 02:13:31,807
I have no complaints!

2110
02:13:32,387 --> 02:13:34,224
Neither of body or mind!

2111
02:13:34,501 --> 02:13:36,419
I have all the happiness and
peace!

2112
02:13:37,158 --> 02:13:38,790
Happiness and peace in this age?

2113
02:13:39,525 --> 02:13:40,842
Whats the technique?

2114
02:13:41,948 --> 02:13:42,737
Technique?

2115
02:13:43,254 --> 02:13:43,876
Simple!

2116
02:13:44,347 --> 02:13:46,378
Open up yourself

2117
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:51,876
......and see world's happiness will pour
in like a storm!

2118
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:54,205
Talk about me...

2119
02:13:54,932 --> 02:13:57,594
.....earlier, I was not open to anyone!

2120
02:13:59,257 --> 02:14:00,312
I used to meet girls....

2121
02:14:00,938 --> 02:14:01,975
...I used to drink a lot

2122
02:14:02,568 --> 02:14:05,718
And I used to think world's happiness
lies in this!

2123
02:14:06,749 --> 02:14:07,242
I was wrong

2124
02:14:08,124 --> 02:14:10,771
The day I have opened my heart....

2125
02:14:11,583 --> 02:14:12,725
....I stopped everything!

2126
02:14:14,111 --> 02:14:18,302
Thats when I found all the happiness
and pleasure!

2127
02:14:20,417 --> 02:14:21,342
How can you leave alcohol?

2128
02:14:22,706 --> 02:14:23,607
I just left it

2129
02:14:24,398 --> 02:14:27,461
Wine, women and even my wife

2130
02:14:28,545 --> 02:14:29,238
Even your wife?

2131
02:14:29,709 --> 02:14:31,365
Am sorry...

2132
02:14:31,835 --> 02:14:33,712
.....sorry my wife left me

2133
02:14:34,287 --> 02:14:35,935
It was difficult for her
to live with me

2134
02:14:36,744 --> 02:14:39,238
On one hand her husband and
on another hand her parties!

2135
02:14:40,367 --> 02:14:41,414
Party, what party?

2136
02:14:51,453 --> 02:14:52,013
Anyway

2137
02:14:52,671 --> 02:14:53,357
Tell me about yourself

2138
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:54,848
How are you?

2139
02:14:54,933 --> 02:14:56,148
I am all fine!

2140
02:14:56,763 --> 02:14:59,449
But I had never thought, you
drastically change!

2141
02:15:00,133 --> 02:15:01,699
A drastic change in you!

2142
02:15:02,324 --> 02:15:03,600
It happens!

2143
02:15:05,236 --> 02:15:07,921
No way is straight in life!

2144
02:15:08,551 --> 02:15:10,252
There is a turning at every point

2145
02:15:14,788 --> 02:15:15,722
You forgot Pushpa?

2146
02:15:16,213 --> 02:15:17,244
How?

2147
02:15:18,148 --> 02:15:21,851
The one who became a mother
of a child and got him treated from you!

2148
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:24,953
Yes!

2149
02:15:28,503 --> 02:15:32,085
That girl opened my mind and soul

2150
02:15:33,049 --> 02:15:33,529
Okay

2151
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:37,443
That guy Nandu....

2152
02:15:38,048 --> 02:15:39,920
....he is an engineer!

2153
02:15:40,367 --> 02:15:41,341
And he stays in this area

2154
02:15:42,327 --> 02:15:42,757
Really?

2155
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:44,811
He must have grown up

2156
02:15:46,168 --> 02:15:49,382
Actually, his son fell ill...

2157
02:15:50,021 --> 02:15:51,266
...and I am doing his treatment

2158
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:56,823
We just remembered you and you are
here!

2159
02:15:57,481 --> 02:15:57,878
Come Nandu

2160
02:16:00,534 --> 02:16:01,325
Greetings

2161
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:02,455
We just remembered you

2162
02:16:03,129 --> 02:16:03,871
You'll live a 100 years

2163
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:05,776
Alone talks wont help.....

2164
02:16:06,602 --> 02:16:09,056
....the one who would bless me
I should find her!

2165
02:16:10,614 --> 02:16:11,406
Why wont you find her?

2166
02:16:12,595 --> 02:16:13,561
I'll bless you

2167
02:16:14,571 --> 02:16:17,217
You live thousands of years!

2168
02:16:18,793 --> 02:16:19,421
You?

2169
02:16:20,012 --> 02:16:20,730
Dint you recognize?

2170
02:16:21,568 --> 02:16:24,573
When you were young and
you used to come to Pushpa's place...

2171
02:16:25,332 --> 02:16:28,532
....I used to get Samose, sweets and Kachoris!

2172
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:31,330
Remember?
You?

2173
02:16:33,798 --> 02:16:34,628

2174
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:36,235

2176
02:16:37,806 --> 02:16:39,813
Nandu, again your son has not fallen ill, right?

2177
02:16:40,813 --> 02:16:41,532
No

2178
02:16:42,174 --> 02:16:44,293
So stop the medicines from today!
Okay

2179
02:16:46,617 --> 02:16:48,392
You had planted night jasmine!

2180
02:16:49,253 --> 02:16:49,946
Is it still there?

2181
02:16:50,699 --> 02:16:51,649
Yes

2182
02:16:51,691 --> 02:16:53,664
I am living in the house opposite
that!

2183
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:54,942
Really?

2184
02:16:55,437 --> 02:16:56,602
Flowers blossom?

2185
02:16:56,962 --> 02:16:57,511

2186
02:16:58,489 --> 02:16:59,879

02:17:01,047 --> 02:17:01,765
Will you show me?

2188
02:17:02,942 --> 02:17:03,410
C'mon

2189
02:17:03,986 --> 02:17:04,640
Lets go

2190
02:17:04,784 --> 02:17:05,494
Okay doctor!

2191
02:17:08,615 --> 02:17:09,220
Anand Babu

2192
02:17:10,298 --> 02:17:11,368
Do you know...

2193
02:17:12,484 --> 02:17:13,371
...where is she?

2194
02:17:15,196 --> 02:17:15,755
She?

2195
02:17:17,194 --> 02:17:17,881
Who Pushpa?

2196
02:17:20,577 --> 02:17:21,871
You want to see her?

2197
02:17:22,601 --> 02:17:23,151
Very much

2198
02:17:24,747 --> 02:17:25,584
You want to meet her?

2199
02:17:27,092 --> 02:17:27,682
Yes

2200
02:17:29,517 --> 02:17:30,062
C'mon

2201
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,709
Even you meet her

2202
02:17:33,564 --> 02:17:34,329
Okay Doctor I am leaving

2203
02:17:36,334 --> 02:17:39,516
What are you doing till now?

2204
02:17:40,012 --> 02:17:41,945
Quickly wash it and give it to me!

2205
02:17:42,557 --> 02:17:44,091
Pushpa

2206
02:17:46,957 --> 02:17:48,298
Pushpa, look who is here

2207
02:17:48,951 --> 02:17:49,341
Look

2208
02:18:00,703 --> 02:18:01,949
Recognized?

2209
02:18:02,522 --> 02:18:03,152
Or I'll have to tell his name!

2210
02:18:05,182 --> 02:18:05,794
Nandu

2211
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:09,662
Saw that? You are surprised
seeing her!

2212
02:18:10,666 --> 02:18:12,336
But Pushpa recognized you

2213
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:14,586
When had I forgotten him?

2214
02:18:15,768 --> 02:18:17,486
Can I ever forget his face?

2215
02:18:18,077 --> 02:18:20,562
Pushpa talk to your son I am
just coming!

2216
02:18:21,633 --> 02:18:24,071
Come son, we'll sit there!

2217
02:18:26,573 --> 02:18:28,010
You have become taller to me!

2218
02:18:29,011 --> 02:18:30,673
But you havent changed a bit

2219
02:18:31,991 --> 02:18:32,909
Big eyes

2220
02:18:34,111 --> 02:18:35,028
The same innocent face

2221
02:18:36,182 --> 02:18:37,180
Come son!

2222
02:18:39,985 --> 02:18:40,607
Sit

2223
02:18:44,943 --> 02:18:47,229
What have you done to yourself?

2224
02:18:48,554 --> 02:18:49,399
You are fine?

2225
02:18:50,198 --> 02:18:51,581
I had remembered you yesterday

2226
02:18:52,143 --> 02:18:54,108
I had cut my finger while
cutting vegetables!

2227
02:18:54,953 --> 02:18:55,559
Remember?

2228
02:18:58,258 --> 02:18:59,617
I have still kept the...

2229
02:19:00,642 --> 02:19:02,192
.....bandage you have tied to me!

2230
02:19:03,971 --> 02:19:05,425
1 more thing is with you!

2231
02:19:08,490 --> 02:19:09,384
My amulet

2232
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:10,555
Remember?

2233
02:19:11,215 --> 02:19:12,821
I had said when I'll grow up...

2234
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,803
...I'll come and take it

2235
02:19:15,795 --> 02:19:16,240
Yes

2236
02:19:17,009 --> 02:19:17,567
I remember!

2237
02:19:18,544 --> 02:19:19,902
Will you give me that amulet?

2238
02:19:20,589 --> 02:19:21,708
For your grandchild!

2239
02:19:23,109 --> 02:19:23,978
My grandchild?

2240
02:19:25,178 --> 02:19:26,280
Your son?

2241
02:19:27,238 --> 02:19:27,923
Yes

2242
02:19:29,384 --> 02:19:31,438
I was going to the temple with him!

2243
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:34,916
And I met you

2244
02:19:36,213 --> 02:19:38,115
Wait, I'll just get it

2245
02:19:59,492 --> 02:20:00,049
Disaster!

2246
02:20:00,526 --> 02:20:02,499
Where did that old woman disappear
leaving these utensils?

2247
02:20:03,667 --> 02:20:05,209
Hey old woman, where are you going?

2248
02:20:05,491 --> 02:20:06,290
Who'll wash these utensils?

2249
02:20:06,388 --> 02:20:06,952
Your father?

2250
02:20:07,459 --> 02:20:08,913
Wait, I am doing it

2251
02:20:10,097 --> 02:20:11,679
What did you say? Lazy!

2252
02:20:12,209 --> 02:20:14,023
I'll find a new maid today

2253
02:20:14,929 --> 02:20:16,950
Its a sin to appoint such
cheap women!

2254
02:20:17,457 --> 02:20:18,192
Big sin

2255
02:20:20,332 --> 02:20:21,218
Take this!

2256
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:28,609
Pushpa!

2257
02:20:29,941 --> 02:20:33,244
Look I have got Samose and
Kachori for your son!

2258
02:20:33,694 --> 02:20:34,590
Make him have!

2259
02:20:43,665 --> 02:20:44,351
Eat

2260
02:20:47,015 --> 02:20:50,420
Not only me even he has not
forgotten anything!

2261
02:20:51,515 --> 02:20:52,593
Nandu you remember?

2262
02:20:53,485 --> 02:20:55,268
In your childhood days, you really
liked it!

2263
02:20:56,502 --> 02:20:58,125
Its hot they'll become
cold!

2264
02:20:59,060 --> 02:20:59,794
Eat!

2265
02:21:01,197 --> 02:21:02,770
Hey you bitch

2266
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:04,291
What are you doing standing there?

2267
02:21:04,694 --> 02:21:05,555
Come here and wash utensils

2268
02:21:09,615 --> 02:21:10,643
Is he an animal?

2269
02:21:13,873 --> 02:21:14,958
Tears in your eyes?

2270
02:21:16,747 --> 02:21:17,521
Anand babu!

2271
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:19,638
How do I explain you?

2272
02:21:20,024 --> 02:21:21,782
I understaood!

2273
02:21:21,912 --> 02:21:24,022
Dont explain me

2274
02:21:25,476 --> 02:21:27,241
Wipe your tears I hate tears!

2275
02:21:28,499 --> 02:21:29,793
You have washed utensils?

2276
02:21:30,063 --> 02:21:31,349
Cant you see?

2277
02:21:31,669 --> 02:21:33,050
Look at the dirt!

2278
02:21:33,625 --> 02:21:36,856
My finger was cut so..!

2279
02:21:37,159 --> 02:21:37,837
Your singer was cut

2280
02:21:38,382 --> 02:21:40,685
I'll take it!
If your fingers are so delicate...

2281
02:21:40,813 --> 02:21:42,018
....leave from here

2282
02:21:42,233 --> 02:21:43,456
Go and dance!

2283
02:21:43,505 --> 02:21:44,368
Perform Mujra (form of dance)

2284
02:21:44,742 --> 02:21:45,852
Shut up

2285
02:21:46,524 --> 02:21:49,970
Who are you to shout here?

2286
02:21:50,634 --> 02:21:52,049
Mind your language!

2287
02:21:52,132 --> 02:21:54,034
What happen?

2288
02:21:54,034 --> 02:21:56,136
Why has everyone gathered here?

2289
02:21:56,187 --> 02:21:59,086
I was shouting at the maid but these
people are hurt!

2290
02:21:59,989 --> 02:22:01,003
Who are you?

2291
02:22:01,091 --> 02:22:03,074
Must be some old friends of
this slut

2292
02:22:03,919 --> 02:22:08,836
I'll hit you royally if once
again you say something about her!

2293
02:22:08,806 --> 02:22:09,181
Understood?

2294
02:22:10,812 --> 02:22:12,571
Now I wont tell her anything!

2295
02:22:14,817 --> 02:22:17,630
Sir, why are you siding our maid?

2296
02:22:18,247 --> 02:22:19,533
What is so special?

2297
02:22:21,493 --> 02:22:22,043
Very much

2298
02:22:22,996 --> 02:22:23,634
There is!

2299
02:22:29,637 --> 02:22:31,874
Seeing her dont you remember your mother?

2300
02:22:37,853 --> 02:22:38,331
Nandu,

2301
02:22:40,162 --> 02:22:42,296
This is a chance to pay back
her favours!

2302
02:22:43,032 --> 02:22:43,501
Favours?

2303
02:22:44,651 --> 02:22:45,242
What favours?

2304
02:22:46,381 --> 02:22:47,275
A mother's debt!

2305
02:22:48,085 --> 02:22:48,923
Childhood debts

2306
02:22:49,605 --> 02:22:52,539
This is the time to take
your mother home...

2307
02:22:53,574 --> 02:22:54,026
No

2308
02:22:54,892 --> 02:22:55,594
Mother

2309
02:22:57,677 --> 02:22:59,435
I wont listen to you

2310
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:01,558
You will have to come along
with me!

2311
02:23:03,283 --> 02:23:04,490
Today is Durga Pooja

2312
02:23:05,305 --> 02:23:07,782
Today mother Durga goes
to her place!

2313
02:23:08,767 --> 02:23:10,773
Today if my mother wont come
along with me...

2314
02:23:11,505 --> 02:23:16,136
....I'll understand there is nothing
like love or affection in this world!

2315
02:23:17,713 --> 02:23:19,472
But

2316
02:23:19,542 --> 02:23:21,013
No buts today!

2317
02:23:21,797 --> 02:23:23,396
Your son is taking you home, you go!

2318
02:23:24,176 --> 02:23:24,750
C'mon mother

2319
02:23:26,225 --> 02:23:27,927

02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:41,686

2324
02:24:08,256 --> 02:24:08,934
What is this?

2325
02:24:10,374 --> 02:24:11,349
Tears in your eyes?

2326
02:24:12,426 --> 02:24:13,375
Eyes

2327
02:24:14,062 --> 02:24:15,741
In my eyes, impossible!

2328
02:24:20,891 --> 02:24:22,291
How did they come out

2329
02:24:25,059 --> 02:24:27,073
The one who always wiped others
tears...

2330
02:24:28,104 --> 02:24:29,870
....theres no one to wipe
his tears?

2331
02:24:31,478 --> 02:24:35,253
Let them flow, they have come
out after a great difficulty!

2332
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:39,752
I dint know crying gives you happiness!

2333

feet
